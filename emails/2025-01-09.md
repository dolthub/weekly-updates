This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm back! I'm not sure what you missed more, reading about Dolt or reading my silly jokes. That's not true. I'm sure it was the jokes. 

### How To Version Control a Database

There are two ways to implement version control: checkpoints and patches and content-addressing. Git popularized the content-addressing approach. In database-land, we have Neon trying to make the checkpoint-and-patch approach work and Dolt going all in on content-addressing. [This article explains the two approaches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-07-how-to-version-control-a-database/) and why content-addressing is the only approach that can offer true version control. Warning: [the article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-07-how-to-version-control-a-database/) contains Prolly Trees.

### When Not To Use Dolt

A user replied to this email and wanted [an article on when not to use Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-30-why-not-dolt). I had to oblige. I bet you didn't know you had that kind of power. Maybe you don't control your database? Maybe Dolt requires too much engineering to adopt? Or maybe Dolt just isn't the right type of database for your use case? These are all good reasons not to choose Dolt as your database.

### Dolt for Nostr or Matrix?

We had a user come by our GitHub issues and [ask about using Dolt with Matrix](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql/issues/2099), a decentralized messaging platform. I answered with my standard decentralized, as in crypto, refrain. "You can store a Dolt URL and hash on a decentralized ledger and be sure the data you are referring to doesn't change". This response missed the mark. 

[Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) is really interested in decentralized software but not in a crypto-way, more in the IPFS-way. He knew a lot about Matrix. His response blew mine out of the water. He was so inspired by the question, he wrote [a whole article about how Dolt fits with Matrix and Nostr](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-05-when-does-dolt-add-value/), two decentralized messaging platforms. Verdict is Matrix: no, Nostr: yes.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
