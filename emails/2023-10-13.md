This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Last week, I made a Canadian Thanksgiving joke and everyone, ok [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) demanded a Canada image. This is what he suggested. No.

### 99.99% Correct

Hot on the heels of [announcing Dolt was 99.9% correct on Sept 6](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-06-three-9s-correctness/), we're now happy to [announce Dolt is 99.99% correct](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-11-four-9s-correctness/). That's 4 9s. This is a [cool article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-11-four-9s-correctness/) because it goes into detail about some of the bugs we fixed in the last month to get that last 9 as well as explain how we used Dolt as a tool to label the data.

### Why SQL?

Dolt is proudly carrying on the tradition of 50 years of SQL. In my [latest blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-09-why-sql/). I dive into the history of SQL over the past 50 years and explain why I think SQL will be around for another 50. As such, Dolt is bringing new version control features to SQL. We are standing on the shoulders of giants.

### Lateral Joins

[Dolt now supports Lateral Joins](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-07-lateral-joins/). I have to be honest, even after reading [Max's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) very well explained article, I'm still not sure what lateral joins are and how to use them. But Dolt supports them and that's a good place to start. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
