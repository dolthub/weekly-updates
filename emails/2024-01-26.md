This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

It's our annual company party this weekend so all of our non-Santa Monica employees are in town. It's very festive at DoltHub HQ. Not much of a joke but I thought you all would like to know.

### Join Statistics

Customers care about SQL correctness and performance. Until recently, Dolt could only use raw table size to estimate which order was best to join tables in. This made a subset of joins much slower in Dolt than other databases like MySQL. This would manifest in a user issue like "This join query took 20 milliseconds in MySQL and 2 seconds in Dolt, what's up?"

Other databases use a technique called table statistics to better choose join order. We [implemented table statistics in November](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-15-index-statistics/) and we're pleased to announce that joins [now use table statistics to compute more optimal join orders](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-22-join-statistics/).

To trigger this functionality, you have to generate table statistics using the `ANALYZE TABLE` query. Next up for [Max](https://www,dolthub.com/team#max) is to generate these statistics automatically in the background. After that, Dolt will perform out of the box as well as MySQL for these types of join queries.

### Dolt Storage and Schema Changes

In a rare seen [Aaron blog post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=aaron)https://www.dolthub.com/blog/), he explains [how Dolt shares data between version in the presence of schema changes](2024-01-19-structural-sharing-with-schema-changes/). The TLDR is when you change your table schema, Dolt has a hard time sharing data between the old and new tables. [The blog](2024-01-19-structural-sharing-with-schema-changes/) outlines some ways to mitigate this if this is a problem for you.

### Dolt works with Metabase

We're on a mission to show that Dolt just works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-24-dolt-metabase/) is on [Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase), an open source database analytics tool. Dolt just works with Metabase. Dolt adds powerful branching and time travel capabilities to the data you analyze with Metabase. [The blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-24-dolt-metabase/) walks through some cool examples.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
