### Dolt works with Metabase

We're on a mission to show that Dolt just works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-24-dolt-metabase/) is on [Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase), an open source database analytics tool. Dolt just works with Metabase and can add powerful branching and time travel capabilities to the data you analyze with Metabase. [The blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-24-dolt-metabase/) walks through some cool examples.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
