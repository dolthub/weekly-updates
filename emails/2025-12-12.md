This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Last week, we announced that [Dolt was now as fast as MySQL on `sysbench`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-04-dolt-is-as-fast-as-mysql). I received a number of congratulatory replies to this email. I write this email every week and send it from my real email address. Just reply to this email if you want to chat. No joke.

### So you want an AI Database?

Here at DoltHub, we have some thoughts on how AI will effect databases. I summarized those thoughts in a two articles this week. The first outlines [a brief history of AI](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-08-brief-history-ai/), setting the table for [my summary of AI databases](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-09-ai-database/). 

For [AI databases](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-09-ai-database/), I outlined how AI will change requirements for databases and which databases can claim to be an AI database today. I think a lot of people thought vector indexes would be the key AI feature for databases but I think it's version control and I'm not alone. This works out pretty well for Dolt, the only truly version-controlled database.

### Doltgres Docker Images

We know from our experience building Dolt that most people use Dolt via [its Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dolthub/dolt-sql-server). [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) and I were discussing how to get more people to try [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt, and it dawned on us that maybe Doltgres needed [a Docker image of its own](https://hub.docker.com/r/dolthub/doltgresql). We're sad it took us so long but [Doltgres now has a Docker image](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-05-announcing-doltgres-docker-image/) modelled after the Postgres Docker image. 

### Dolt + FIT

I reckon from the out of office replies I get to this email that a few academics are on this mailing this. This one is for you. Calving Williamson, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York [adopted Dolt for a number of use cases](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-11-dolt-fit/). The one I am most excited about is teaching students how to use AI with databases safely using branches. [Read more here](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-11-dolt-fit/) and consider adopting Dolt in your own classrooms. 

Until next week.
