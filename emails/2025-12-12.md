This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Last week, we announced that [Dolt was now as fast as MySQL on sysbench](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-04-dolt-is-as-fast-as-mysql). I received a number of congratulatory replies to this email. I write this email every week and it comes from my real email address. Just reply if you want to discuss anything. No joke.
