This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm back from vacation and love is in the air. Tomorrow on all your dates, make sure to bring up version-controlled databases to set the right mood.

### Cursor for SQL

If you pay attention to one thing in this update, it's this: [Dolt Workbench now has agent mode](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-09-introducing-agent-mode/). 

The combination of a SQL Workbench, version control, and a connected agent window brings the Cursor experience to databases. It just feels right. Chat with the agent to do data analysis or even make writes! If the agent messes something up, don't make a Dolt commit. The Dolt Workbench is the best way to experience Dolt as [the databases for AI](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-09-ai-database/). 

Please [try it](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench) and [give us feedback](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench/issues). It's free and open source. BYOAK (bring your own Anthropic key).

### Hosted MCP

Continuing on the AI theme, we [launched MCP support in Hosted Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-03-hosted-dolt-mcp/). Last year, [Dolt began shipping with a built-in MCP server](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-09-announcing-dolt-sql-server-mcp/). Add a section to your `config.yaml` and an MCP server port would open along with a standard SQL server port. Now, the same port can be enabled on Hosted Dolt. As a reminder, Dolt's version control functionality makes it safe for agents to make writes to you database via MCP.

### EU AI Act Compliance

The European Union has a new set of AI regulations set to start being enforced in August 2026. If you are based in the EU and subject to this new regulation, [Dolt can help with compliance](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-02-eu-ai-act/). I read the whole law to write [the article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-02-eu-ai-act/). Dolt specifically helps with the Data Governance and Human Oversight provisions.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
