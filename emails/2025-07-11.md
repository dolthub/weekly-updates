This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm back from a week hiatus. I know you missed me. No joke, there's a lot to catch you up on...

### The Agentic Software Engineer

Some of you may know, I've been [working with Claude Code a lot](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-10-claude-code-my-new-best-friend/). I've used it so much I've started to notice [some common gotchas](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-30-claude-code-gotchas/). 

I started out skeptical but now I'm a full blown believer. Agents are going to do a lot of work for us. [Agents need branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/). Dolt is the [only database with branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-18-database-branches/). Dolt is the database for agents. Not only am I believer, I am also biased.

Anyway, I have some thoughts on [how software engineers can prepare for the agentic future](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-02-the-agentic-software-engineer/). I've managed thousands of software engineers in my career so my career advice is at least mildly qualified. Agents are going to change what it means to be a software engineer and you might as well start now building the skills you'll need in the new agentic world. 

Interestingly, [this post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-02-the-agentic-software-engineer/) did terrible on Reddit and great on LinkedIn. It's kind of perfect LinkedIn content.

### More Prolly Trees

Belatedly, Nick's [post on "Prollyferation"](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-03-people-keep-inventing-prolly-trees/), the mass invention of Prolly Trees, went viral a second time last week. He wrote [a follow up post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-03-regarding-prollyferation/) extending some of his thoughts. Both posts are fun looks at Dolt's core data structure, the [Prolly Tree](https://docs.dolthub.com/architecture/storage-engine/prolly-tree).

### Doltgres Correctness

We continue to grind out [Doltgres correctness fixes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-08-doltgres-correctness-testing/). The Postgres syntax is much more expansive than that of MySQL. We continue to discover interesting SQL, like [set returning functions](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-27-postgres-set-functions-are-weird/). We are on the cusp of announcing [extension support](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-06-loading-native-extensions/), so stay tuned if you're waiting for those to jump into Doltgres. We're definitely ready, willing, and able to work with a motivated user to be the first public Doltgres user. Just reply to this email if you think that could be you.


Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
