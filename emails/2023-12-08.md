This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

If you want to see the face and hear the voice behind these emails, I was on [The Hacking postgres podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1a5ovDUBsM) talking about [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql). And yes, I really like history podcasts but I don't think about the Roman Empire any other time except when I'm listening to podcasts about it.

### Entity Framework Core Works with Dolt

We're on a mission to show that Dolt just works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-04-works-with-dolt-efcore/) is on C#, .NET, and the [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) ORM. We want you all to know that Dolt proudly works on Windows with all the tools Windows developers know and love.

[Jason's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) [blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-04-works-with-dolt-efcore/) details with [sample code](https://github.com/dolthub/efcore-sample) how to get Dolt working with EFCore.

We also published [a documentation page](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps) with links to all the tools we've shown work with Dolt. Anything that works with MySQL should just work with Dolt.

### Sizing Your Dolt Instance

We started getting a lot of questions about how big a host one should provision to run Dolt. So, I wrote a [blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-06-sizing-your-dolt-instance/) detailing Dolt's somewhat unique resource requirements. Dolt uses more disk and memory than other OLTP databases but has no special requirements for CPU or network. [This blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-06-sizing-your-dolt-instance/) details some rules of thumb to estimate how much disk and memory you'll need for your host running Dolt.

### Why are Golang Heaps So Complicated

[Max](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) wrote the latest in [our Golang blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang). This time he talks about [heaps in Golang](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-01-why-are-go-heaps-confusing/). Max notes heaps may be a bit more confusing then they need to be.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
