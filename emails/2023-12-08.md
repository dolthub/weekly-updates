### Entity Framework Core Work with Dolt

We're on a mission to show that Dolt just works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-04-works-with-dolt-efcore/) is on C#, .NET, and the [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) ORM. We want you all to know that Dolt proudly works on Windows with all the tools Windows developers know and love.

[Jason's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) [blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-04-works-with-dolt-efcore/) details with [sample code](https://github.com/dolthub/efcore-sample) how to get Dolt working with EFCore.

### Sizing Your Dolt Instance

We started getting a lot of questions about how big a host one should provision to run Dolt. So, I wrote a [blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-06-sizing-your-dolt-instance/) detailing Dolt's somewhat unique resource requirements. Dolt uses more disk and memory than other OLTP databases but has not special requirements for CPU or network. This blog article details some rules of thumb to estimate how much disk and memory you'll need for your host running Dolt.

### Why are Golang Heaps So Complicated

[Max](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) wrote the latest in [our Golang blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang). This time he talks about [heaps in Golang](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-01-why-are-go-heaps-confusing/). Max notes heaps may be a bit more confusing then they need to be.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
