This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I received so many joke suggestions after last week's email. It was quite inspiring to know that so many people read this update not for the database content, but for my silly joke. Here was the recommendation I liked the most, inspired by a reader's child:

Knock, knock.  
Who's there?  
Olive the branch.
Olive the branch who?  
Olive the branch and other Git features in Dolt.  

This is especially topical because [Dolt is the only SQL database with true branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-18-database-branches/).
