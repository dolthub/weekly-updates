This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

It's time to break out the meme! [Max](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) made it to #1 on Hackernews with [his SQL Engine article](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43807593). I'm actually not sure if it made it all the way to #1 but the traffic and upvotes suggest yes. So, meme it is.

### Anatomy of a SQL Engine

[Max's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) [magnum opus](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-25-sql-engine-anatomy/) discusses the code he's worked on for the past two years. Dolt has a custom SQL engine. Max's job is to improve its performance and correctness. He's responsible for the last two years of this performance comparison chart of Dolt to MySQL on sysbench and TPC-C benchmarks.

So, who better to write about [how the engine works](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-25-sql-engine-anatomy/)? Max discusses the various stages of how Dolt parses, processes and returns results of SQL queries. This is a good one and well worth the read.

### Doltgres Triggers

In case you missed it, [Doltgres went Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-16-doltgres-goes-beta/) two weeks ago. [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql) is the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. 

One thing we didn't quite get in before Beta launch was triggers. Well, the wait is over. [Doltgres supports triggers](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-30-doltgres-supports-triggers/). [Daylon's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#daylon) launch blog goes over an example of how to use triggers in Postgres and Doltgres.

We continue to invest heavily in Doltgres. Please try it out. If you need a feature or syntax we'll prioritize your request.

### Homebrew

Most of us use Mac laptops here at DoltHub for development. We all use Homebrew extensively to manage and install software. [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) took the time to [explain how Homebrew works](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-01-optimizing-heap-allocations%20copy/), in light of a recent dependency mess we found ourselves in.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
