This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

If you're getting tired of all the agent talk in the industry right now, stop reading and delete this email right now. I'm obsessed with agents and can't stop talking about them. Dolt is the database for agents.

### Agents Need Tests

I'm working on [a theory](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-06-agents-need-tests/) about why Claude Code and other coding agents work so well. I believe coding agents work because of capable AI models, version control, and automated verification. This combination allows agents to loop on a task until it is known correct. I'm interested in this topic because I think Dolt can help bring agents to more domains, specifically, applications backed by SQL databases. Dolt is the only SQL database with version control and a built-in test engine.

In service of this theory, I wrote multiple articles this week. The first outlines how [agents need tests](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-06-agents-need-tests/). Dolt is the only database with a built-in test engine, a little known feature called Dolt CI. To follow that up, I wrote an article with [a salient example](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-07-agents-need-tests-example/) showing how tests in Dolt help an agent do better work.

Agents need branches and tests. Dolt is the only database with both of those. Dolt is the database for agents.

### AGENT.md

We also released [a new Dolt doc this week called `AGENT.md`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-05-agent-dot-md/). If you have a Dolt database and you want Claude Code to know how to use it in its session, just do the following:

```sh
$ dolt docs print AGENT.md > CLAUDE.md
$ claude
```

With that, prompt away and you'll be surprised at how well Claude Code can work with Dolt.

### Per Branch Connection Pools

We had a user curious about how to use Dolt branches effectively with connection pools. We faced this problem in the past but our documentation was sparse. So, [Neil](https://www.dolthub.com) wrote a [sample application](https://github.com/dolthub/sudoku-node-app) and [blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-04-branch-connection-pooling/) about how to best use connection pools with Dolt branches.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
