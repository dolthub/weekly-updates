This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm heading to the mother country next week to ski. Here in LA, I choose winter. Winter does not choose me. No email next week. Savor this one because it needs to last an extra week.

### Dolt + Metabase: Agent Edition

[Dolt works with Metabase](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-24-dolt-metabase/). We showed you in 2024. "But wait!", you say, "That's just connecting to Dolt and making dashboards. I want to version my dashboards using Dolt. I want to have agents create dashboards on branches and review their work."

You can do that too! [Nathan's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nathan) latest article, [Dolt + Metabase: Agent Edition]() gives you a detailed how to. No code changes to Metabase required.

### Agents Work Longer with Beads

[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) has been in the news lately because [Claude Code cited Beads as inspiration for its introduction of Tasks](https://x.com/trq212/status/2014480496013803643). As many of you know, [Beads is migrating to Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-15-a-day-in-gas-town/#can-dolt-help-beads) so we're kind of rooting for Beads in this one. 

Anyway, last week I wrote about [agentic memory](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-27-long-running-agentic-work-with-beads/) and talked about how [Beads made an agent work for 12 hours](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-22-agentic-memory/#tasks). This claim prompted some questions from readers. So, this week [Dustin](https://www.dolthub.com/team#dustin), who was the one who achieved this stellar performance, wrote about [how he did it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-27-long-running-agentic-work-with-beads/).

### Crashing VMs

We're at the paranoia stage of Dolt durability. Let's crash as many VMs running Dolt as possible and see if we can get a Dolt database we can't load. [Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron) wrote about [the infrastructure needed to do this type of testing](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-26-dolt-crash-recovery-testing/). He's been working on the testing framework for a couple months. The topic is surprisingly nuanced. Hopefully [his article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-26-dolt-crash-recovery-testing/) helps others beginning their durability journey.
