This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Tomorrow, I'm the ripe old age of 44. Palindrome birthdays are the best birthdays. Birthday wishes will be accepted graciously.

### Better MySQL Function Support

MySQL supports [a lot of functions](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/sql-support/expressions-functions-operators#functions-and-operators). Previously our strategy has been to wait for people to ask before we implement a missing one. We can usually turn around a function in a day or so. 

Recently, we've got more proactive. [James](https://www.dolthub.com/team#james) is [hard wat work](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-29-sql-improvement/) implementing functions Dolt is missing, roughly is easiest to hardest order. Please don't hesitate to ask us for functions you need.

### Dolt and Django

We're on a mission to show that Dolt just works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-31-dolt-django/) is on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a popular Python-based website builder with a built-in ORM.

We had [previously](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=django) made Dolt work with Django for the [Nautobot integration](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-24-announcing-nautobot-on-dolt/). For [this blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-31-dolt-django/), we start at the basics and use Dolt to build branches and merges into the Django administration console. The [sample website source code](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt_django) is also available if you just want to play with it.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
