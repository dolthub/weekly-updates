This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

My favorite part of the new internet is getting accused of being GPT. I promise I write all these emails myself, including the terrible jokes. This is pure Tim, no GPT influence.

### Built-In MCP Server

A few weeks ago, we announced the release of [the Dolt Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-14-announcing-dolt-mcp/). 

But we weren't done. Dolt is [the database for agents](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/). What better way to show our commitment to this new moniker than to make MCP a first class interface? [We added our Dolt MCP server to the Dolt binary itself](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-09-announcing-dolt-sql-server-mcp/).

Now, you can start an MCP server along with a SQL server on the command line or by adding these lines to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# config.yaml

mcp_server:
  port: 7007
  user: root
  password: ""
  database: ""
```

This starts an MCP server connected to your Dolt database on port 7007, the obvious agent port.

### Dolt as a Data Warehouse 

People often ask for an Online Analytics Processing (OLAP) version of Dolt. OLAP databases are databases like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, and Clickhouse. These databases often are laid out differently in storage, making Dolt's [Prolly Tree](https://docs.dolthub.com/architecture/storage-engine/prolly-tree)-based engine tricky to adapt. [Aaron](https://www;dolthub.com/team#aaron) attempts to explain in [his latest article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-10-challenges-with-prolly-trees-and-columnar-storage/).

### Maxwell's Daemon Works with Dolt

We're on a mission to show you Dolt works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) shows how [Dolt integrates with Maxwell's Daemon](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-05-maxwell-works-with-dolt/), a popular [Change Data Capture](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-01-change-data-capture/) tool developed by Zendesk.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
