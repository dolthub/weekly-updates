### The Dolt 24-Hour Pledge

Some of you may know that we have pledged to fix Dolt correctness bugs in 24 hours or less. I wrote [a blog explaining how we do it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-15-24-hour-bug-fixes/), mostly to reiterate the pledge. We're all about earning your trust in Dolt and we think fixing bugs quickly is a great way to earn trust.

### ok Considered Harmful

For the latest in our [Golang Blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang), [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) wrote about [calling variables "ok" in Golang](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-10-ok-considered-harmful/). Reddit was [not nice to him](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1cp04su/ok_considered_harmful/). But, we've had a couple people come by [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe) with more positive feedback and it was picked up by [Golang weekly](https://golangweekly.com/issues/507). So, on balance, I think it's safe to read.
