This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Did you know Canada has a different Thanksgiving? Yes. Yes it does. This year it is Monday, Oct. 9. While I'm Canadian, so Happy Thanksgiving. In Canada, having Thanksgiving in November would be a decidedly Winter, not Fall, themed holiday. 

### Events Work

In May, [we announced support for scheduled events syntax](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-30-introducing-dolt-events/). Scheduled events are like cron jobs you configure and run in your database server. At launch, we would store the events but they would not run. Our intent was to quickly follow on with actually making them work. We were rudely interrupted by a crying baby.

While, we finally sorted that all out and got around to [making events work](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-02-scheduled-events/). A really good use case is scheduling a `dolt_gc()` call to clean up all the orphaned chunks in your database.

### Hosted Replication is Better

We keep chugging along improving [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com) so it's the best, easiest place to run a Dolt database. [Our current focus is replication](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-04-replication-updates/). We now replicate permissions and `drop database` queries. Coming soon is "click a button" failover and then automated failover.

### Using AWS Lambda with Golang

The latest in our [Golang blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is out, [Using AWS Lambda with Golang to Generate On-call Calendars](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-29-go-aws-on-call-schedule/). This blog explains how to use AWS Lambda instances with Golang, all for a really useful case. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
