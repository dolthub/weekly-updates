### Stored Procedure Improvements

[Daylon](https://www.dolthub.com/team#alec) [improved stored procedures](). Here at DoltHub, we [manage by blog post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-07-02-manage-by-blog-post/). Daylon was only going to variables and cursors but as he started writing his blog, he realized his customer focused examples were lame without loops and handlers. So, you got all those features and a better blog. Everyone wins! Except maybe Daylon who had to work harder to get this done.

Even better, blob imports are faster now. Blobs include includes `TEXT` and `JSON` columns.
