This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub.

This week we were #1 on HackerNews for the second time this summer thanks to [Alec](https://www.dolthub.com/team#alec) (aka [@spacelove](https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu)). Alec is our resident data scientist/bounty hunter and he lives in Queens, New York. This is a photo of @spacelove at a Manhattan night club this week.

### A Trillion Prices

Jokes aside. How in the world are there [petabytes of medical pricing information](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-02-a-trillion-prices/)? Alec's blog went viral especially [amongst libertarian economists](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/09/thursday-assorted-links-371.html). We're looking at this data and want to run a bounty on it. Stay tuned.

### Improved Common Table Expression (CTE) Support

We [launched Common Table Expressions](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-03-24-common-table-expressions/), SQL `WITH` syntax, in March of last year. A [bunch of CTE bugs](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+CTE) came in over the past couple weeks. In response, Dolt's CTE support in [0.41.0](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/tag/v0.41.0) is much improved.

### Data Diff

Here at DoltHub, we're the experts in [data diff](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-09-data-diff/). We published a survey of the data diff space. These blogs are mostly meant for search but this one has some good content (but I'm a little biased as the author). Check it out if you're interested in other data diff tools.

Until next week.
