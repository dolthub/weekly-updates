This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

[Zach](htpps://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) wrote a very funny but very misleading [April Fool's day blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-01-rewriting-dolt-in-rust/) about migrating Dolt to Rust. I vetoed it because I'm not funny. But you can [read it here](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-01-rewriting-dolt-in-rust/) if you must.

### Vibe Coding

We're starting to think the artificial intelligence era of software engineering, or vibe coding era as we call it, is going to be very kind to Dolt adoption. A couple weeks ago, we wrote about [how AI Agents need version controlled databases](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/) and then a week later Cursor engineers, the vibe coding leaders, [were on a very popular podcast confirming our hypothesis](https://lexfridman.com/cursor-team-transcript/#chapter13_branching_file_systems).

This week, [Neil](https://www,dolthub.com/team#neil) took his 25 years of software engineering experience to Cursor and [wrote about the experience in general](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-29-vibin/). He then dove deep into [how to use Cursor with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-31-vibin-with-reset/). It turns out `reset --hard` is really useful when you let an AI write and run code on your behalf. Dolt is the only SQL database where you can reset quickly and easily. Use Dolt and let the vibe coding era begin!

### Private Hosted Deployments in Google Cloud

Lat year, we launched [Hosted Dolt Private Deployments in AWS](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-21-hosted-private-deployments/). These allow Hosted Dolt to be used from your own Virtual Private Cloud without using the public internet, but still managed by us. This deployment strategy is very popular and we received requests from our Google Cloud Platform (GCP) customers for the same capability. Last week, we launched the [same private connect feature for GCP](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-28-hosted-dolt-using-psc/). If you're a potential Hosted Dolt customer on Google Cloud Platform waiting for a private link, wait no longer.

### SQL Bot

Last week we [announced the SQL Bot launch on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-25-announcing-an-llm-powered-sql-assistant-on-dolthub/). We were sparse on details on how it works. We weren't being cagey. We were just working on a deadline. This week, we [wrote about how the SQL Bot works](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-02-dolthub-sql-assistant-technical-details/) and some of the requirements. Frankly, we're looking for ideas on how to make it work better and not spend a fortune. Read [the article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-02-dolthub-sql-assistant-technical-details/) and if you have any helpful suggestions, reply to this email.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
