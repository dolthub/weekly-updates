This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

To fill in all the newcomers, I lead this weekly update with a joke. I'm not funny. I don't like it. I'm not sure why I committed to doing it.

### Bolt works with Dolt

We've tested Dolt with [Replit](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-15-replit-works-with-dolt/), [Vercel v0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-01-vercel-v0-works-with-dolt/), [Lovable](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-28-lovable-works-with-dolt/) and now the last popular app builder, [Bolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-04-bolt-works-with-dolt/). Replit is our favorite. 

We think Dolt is the ideal database to back app builder built apps. A version controlled database makes it easy to recover from an agent's mistakes. 

We also think Dolt's version control capabilities, when integrated deeply with the app builder itself, can provide improved customer experiences making app builders multiplayer. Each user can be building on a branch and merge the code and database together when they are ready.

### Agentic List Builder Using Dolt

We're looking for ways to show off Dolt's capabilities for agentic applications. As such, [Eric](https://www.dolthub.com/team#eric) built [a sample agentic list builder](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-31-agentic-systems-need-version-control/) using Claude combined with Dolt branches and merges. We're looking for more sample applications to build to show off how Dolt's agentic capabilities. If you have an idea, just reply to this email.

### DoltLab works with Podman

We've had a number of people who for whatever reason prefer Podman over Docker for DoltLab. I think of Podman as the hipster Docker. The [latest DoltLab now works with Podman](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-05-announcing-doltlab-on-podman/) by changing a configuration value in the installer.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
