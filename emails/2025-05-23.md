This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Recently, [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) called me "TimGPT" because I tend to repeat the same points in different ways for my blog articles. I agreed and suggested I had a Grok-like bug where instead of trying to work South Africa into every response, I try to bring up [Prolly Trees](https://docs.dolthub.com/architecture/storage-engine/prolly-tree). 

### Millions of Rows, Versions, and Branches

Speaking of [Prolly Trees](https://docs.dolthub.com/architecture/storage-engine/prolly-tree), combining Prolly Trees with a Git-style commit graph [allows Dolt to scale to millions of rows, versions, and branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-16-millions-of-versions/). I dive a lot deeper into the mechanics in [this article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-16-millions-of-versions/).

### Convince a Stakeholder

I know a lot of people reading this email want to use Dolt but need to convince some other stakeholders. I made [a cheat sheet](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-22-convince-your-dba/) of all the common objections to Dolt we hear and our responses. If you're hearing something that isn't on there, please reply to this email and let me know.

### Dolt Works with Vault

[Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault) is an open source credential management system built by Hashicorp. You'll be happy to know you can [use Vault to manage your Dolt SQL users](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-20-vault-works-with-dolt/). Upon testing, we discovered an issue with some `REVOKE` and `GRANT OPTION` statements and we already have [a Pull Request](https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/2988) out to fix them. By the time you set up Vault, the latest Dolt release should have the required statements implemented.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
