This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

On this All Hallows Eve, I remind you that Dolt protects you from database evil spirits like `drop table` or an under specified `update`. 

### Agents Need Diffs

One of our inspirations here at DoltHub is Andrej Karpathy. His [Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) article in 2017 was one of the inspirations for Dolt and DoltHub. He was [recently on the Dwarkesh podcast](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy) talking all things AI. His comments on how [agents need diffs](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-30-karpathy-agents-need-diffs/) caught our attention. Obviously, we agree so I had to write [a response](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-30-karpathy-agents-need-diffs/).

### `dolt_branch_activity` System Table

We continue to improve Dolt's version control functionality. There's a lot of open space to innovate at the intersection of version control and SQL. This week we announced [the release of the `dolt_branch_activity` table](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-27-branch-activity/). This table allows you to identify stale branches.

### Lovable vs Vercel v0 vs Replit

We are very interested in AI App Builders here at DoltHub. A couple weeks ago, [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) has showed how to use [Vercel v0 with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=vercel) and how [Replit works with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-15-replit-works-with-dolt/). This week, he [tries out Lovable with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-28-lovable-works-with-dolt/). Replit remains the best of breed in this space.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
