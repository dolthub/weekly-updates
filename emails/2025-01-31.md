This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

It's our annual company get together in Santa Monica this weekend. We have offices in Seattle and Santa Monica and a handful of remote folks. It will be nice to see everyone except [Zach](https://www'dolthub.com/team#zach).

### Dolt vs MongoDB

We're starting to think that [Prolly Trees are the best way to store JSON in a database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-15-json-prolly-trees/). Dolt has taken the Pepsi challenge against [MySQL](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-09-json-mysql-vs-dolt/), [Postgres](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-22-json-postgres-vs-dolt/), and [SQLite](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-18-json-sqlite-vs-dolt/) on our JSON benchmarks and come out on top. This week, [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) has [Dolt take on the JSON database itself, MongoDB](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-30-json-mongodb-vs-dolt/). Dolt is compares favorably to MongoDB for most operations and can handle larger documents.

If you have a heavy JSON use case, let's see if we can get you on Dolt so you can enjoy all these performance wins and get the benefits of version control. 

### The State of Hospital Price Transparency Data

For many years, we collected US hospital price data via our bounty program. We haven't collected new data in over a year but people continue to show up in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe) interested in the project. Instead of answering questions individually, I summarized the state of the world in [a handy blog post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-28-state-of-hospital-price-transparency-data/). 

We are interested in potentially continuing to collect data in a different fashion that I talk about at [the end of the post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-28-state-of-hospital-price-transparency-data/#whats-next). If you're interested in that project, please respond to this email.

### `sqlx` Works with Dolt

We're on a mission to show that Dolt works with [all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps). This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-24-go-sql-with-dolt/) is on Golang's standard SQL connection utilities including `sqlx`. As many of you know, we're a Golang shop here at DoltHub so we better make sure standard Golang tooling works with Dlt.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
