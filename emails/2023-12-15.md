This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

As some of you know, we [manage by blog post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-07-02-manage-by-blog-post/). We publish three/week and we've been doing it for four years. That's a lot of blogs!

```
ls -a web/packages/blog/src/pages | grep .md | wc -l
     609
```

Well, this week you got treated to [five blogs](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/)! Why? I wrote two extra blogs for the Christmas and New Year's slots but once they were done I thought to myself, "Why hold back?" and published them anyway. It's my gift to you, the reader.

### Making Massive Joins Fast



### Doltgres Contribution Guide



### Dolt Transaction Concurrency Example



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
