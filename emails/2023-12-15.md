This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

As some of you know, we [manage by blog post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-07-02-manage-by-blog-post/). We publish three/week and we've been doing it for four years. That's a lot of blogs!

```
ls -a web/packages/blog/src/pages | grep .md | wc -l

```

Well, this week you got treated to [five blogs](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/)! Why? I wrote two extra blogs for the Christmas and New Year's slots but once they were done I thought to myself, "Why hold back?" and published them anyway. It's my gift to you, the reader.

### Update on the EBS Performance Regression

Regular readers may remember we had a [spooky performance regression](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-22-spooky-performance-regression-aws-ebs/) in our `sysbench` tests that made us look like we were faster than MySQL for some tests. This had us all in a tizzy.

We [figured it out](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-08-christmas-come-early-ebs-performance-regression-update/) with the help of a reader. A helpful reader showed up on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe) and suggested we use EBS GP3 instead of GP2 and it turns out only GP2 volumes suffered from this performance regression. Problem solved. We're back to 1.7X MySQL on `sysbench` as expected. No free relative performance wins for us.
