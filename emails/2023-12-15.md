This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

As some of you know, here at DoltHub, we [manage by blog post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-07-02-manage-by-blog-post/). We publish three blogs per week and we've been doing it for four years. That's a lot of blogs! 609 to be exact.

```
ls -a web/packages/blog/src/pages | grep .md | wc -l
     609
```

Well, this week you got treated to [five blogs](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/)! Why? I wrote two extra blogs for the Christmas and New Year's slots but once they were done I thought to myself, "Why hold back?" and published them anyway. It's my gift to you, the reader.

### Making Massive Joins Fast

Our SQL Analyzer is getting pretty good, in some places surpassing MySQL's. One of those places is in massive join performance. Check out [Nick's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) [blog on how we used functional analysis to improve join performance](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-13-functional-dependency-analysis/). It's a bit of a deep dive but definitely worth it if your interested in how SQL databases work underneath the covers.

### Update on the EBS Performance Regression

Regular readers may remember we had a [spooky performance regression](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-22-spooky-performance-regression-aws-ebs/) in our `sysbench` tests that made us look like we were faster than MySQL for some tests. This had us all in a tizzy.

We [figured it out](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-08-christmas-come-early-ebs-performance-regression-update/) with the help of a reader. A helpful reader showed up on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe) and suggested we use EBS GP3 instead of GP2 and it turns out only GP2 volumes suffered from this performance regression. Problem solved. We're back to 1.7X MySQL on `sysbench` as expected. No free relative performance wins for us.

### Dolt Transaction Concurrency Example

Dolt is more susceptible to the lost update problem because it uses merge logic on transaction commit. Using [a detailed example I show what this means](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-14-concurrent-transaction-example/) in your Dolt-powered application. The solution is row level locking. Coming Soon.

Plus, this featured image is some of the best work of my career.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
