This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Dolt wants to be your valentine. Instead of chocolates and roses, it comes bearing diffs and branches. I don't know about you, but version control is my love language.

### Hosted Doltgres

We're marching as fast as we can towards [Doltgres Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-06-doltgres-beta/). A key milestone in the journey was [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com) support for [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), our Postgres-flavored version of Dolt. 

Last Friday, we launched support for [Hosted Doltgres](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-07-hosted-doltgres/). Grab a demo instance and start playing today. Even if you're not a hosted customer, this launch signals that Doltgres has functioning permissions, monitoring, and backup systems. We're almost ready for the Beta launch. Stay tuned.

### Workbench Custom Title Bar

One of my favorite recent product launches is the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench). It's a modern SQL workbench that works with any MySQL or Postgres compatible database but [really shines when connected to Dolt or Doltgres](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-02-workbench-better-with-version-control/). Grab it today from the [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolt-workbench/id6720702995?mt=12) or [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nq8lqph9vvh?hl=en-us&gl=US) App store. Or pop by [GitHub](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench) and grab the installer from releases if that works better for you. 

The Dolt Workbench uses much of the React code we perfected building DoltHub. In order to make it a desktop application we [used Electron](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-11-building-an-electron-app-with-nextjs/). This week, [Liu Liu](https://www.dolthub.com/team#liuliu) explains how to make a [custom title bar in Electron](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-11-building-a-custom-title-bar-in-electron/), knowledge she gained adding one to the Dolt Workbench.

### Table Statistics V2

Table statistics are a requisite feature of modern OLTP databases used to speed up complex SQL queries. [How do you scale table statistics to thousands of branches?](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-13-branch-stats/) [Max](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) previews his latest attempt in [his recent blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-13-branch-stats/). As you might expect, we leverage our magic data structure, [Prolly Trees](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-03-prolly-trees/), for structural sharing.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
