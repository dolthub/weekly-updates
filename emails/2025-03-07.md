This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This week we celebrate the life and death of our friend, the [robot blogger](https://github.com/dolthub/robot-blogger). Its [terrible blog content](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-22-comparing-dolt-and-git-generated/) will not be missed. The GPUs it was consuming will be put to better use.

### Automatic Garbage Collection

I know [I talked about this last week](https://github.com/dolthub/weekly-updates/blob/main/emails/2025-02-28.md) but it's kind of a big deal so I'll shout about it again. Dolt now supports [automatic, non-intrusive garbage collection](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-28-announcing-automatic-gc-in-sql-server/). Turn it on in [your config.yaml](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/server/configuration#config.yaml) with:

```yaml
behavior:
  auto_gc_behavior:
    enable: true
```

We need enough people using it to trust it enough to make it teh default. We're using it for DoltHub.

### Dolt in the Dolt Workbench

I've been writing a [Dolt for Beginners series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=beginners). One of the first thing I have to mention in Dolt is how to install it and how to make sure it is installed. This involves a Terminal like Powershell on Windows or Terminal on Mac. I'm sure there is a large percentage of the user population that immediately stops reading and says, "Dolt is not for me". Well, I now have an answer for those users. Use the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench)!

Now, you never have to touch a terminal to use Dolt. [The Dolt Workbench ships with Dolt included](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-06-the-dolt-workbench-now-ships-with-a-built-in-dolt-server/) and you just need to click the local option and have the Workbench manage the server for you. Much better for beginners. The Dolt Workbench can be installed from the [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nq8lqph9vvh?hl=en-us&gl=US) or [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolt-workbench/id6720702995?mt=12) app stores.

### RIP Robot Blogger

Well, that was fast. After only one [iconic blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-22-comparing-dolt-and-git-generated/), the [robot blogger has been shelved](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-04-robot-blogs-suck/). No GPUs for you. 

It turns out, even with [RAG](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-18-learning-about-rag/) from our current corpus of blog articles, weekly emails, and documentation, we just [couldn't make the thing generate good content](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-04-robot-blogs-suck/). It was faster to write the blog ourself than to construct the prompt to get content even close to what we would publish.

We're still investing heavily in AI use cases this year. We've pivoted to [making the DoltHub query box accept natural language and give SQL corrections](https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-issues/issues/574). We think current state of the art LLMs + RAG will be much better for this more constrained use case.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
