### Nil in Golang

[Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) has the blog bug. After his first [Avoiding Pitfalls in Go](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-08-16-go-pitfalls/) blog did some numbers, he quickly followed up with [Much Ado About Nil Things: More Go Pitfalls](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-08-much-ado-about-nil-things/). First, great title. I'm oozing with pride. Second, `nil` in Golang is weird. [Read more about it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-08-much-ado-about-nil-things/).

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
