### Will it Merge?

We've been working hard making more merges "just work". In May, we released [Schema Conflicts](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-01-schema-conflicts/), which set the stage for improved [schema merge](https://docs.dolthub.com/concepts/dolt/git/conflicts#schema). Since then [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) has been hard at work making more schema changes merge. He summarizes his improvements with examples in [his latest blog post, "Will it Merge?"](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-11-will-it-merge/).

### Single Sign On For Hosted Dolt

[Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com) continues to get better for our enterprise customers. We [released Single Sign On](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-13-hosted-dolt-supports-sso/) this week. [Taylor's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) blog, walks through an example of connecting Hosted Dolt to Okta. We have also tried it with Google as an identity provider. Let us know if there are any other blockers for your adoption of Hosted Dolt is your enterprise.

### Nil in Golang

[Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) has the blog bug. After his first [Avoiding Pitfalls in Go](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-08-16-go-pitfalls/) blog did some numbers, he quickly followed up with [Much Ado About Nil Things: More Go Pitfalls](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-08-much-ado-about-nil-things/). First, great title. I'm oozing with pride. Second, `nil` in Golang is weird. [Read more about it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-08-much-ado-about-nil-things/).

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
