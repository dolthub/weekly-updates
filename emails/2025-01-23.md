This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Dolt is getting a lot of new fans so it's a good time to remind people Dolt is [named after Git](https://docs.dolthub.com/other/faq#why-is-it-called-dolt-are-you-calling-me-dumb). We're not trying to call you stupid. Was it a good idea to name a database Dolt? Probably not. But here we are.

### Agentic Memory

Why does every Claude Code session start as a blank slate? 

Hot on the heels of last week's [Gas Town article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-15-a-day-in-gas-town/), I dive deeper into the whole topic of [agentic memory](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-22-agentic-memory/). I start with agent basics and work up to why [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) works so well for agentic memory. I conclude with how Dolt can help. 

[Agentic memory](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-22-agentic-memory/) is a new and exciting topic. We're very excited to partner with agentic memory tools. If that's you, just reply to this email.

### Dolt with ORMs

The main way developers build applications against Dolt is through Object Relational Mappers (ORMs). Through the years, we've built a number of features into Dolt to make working with ORMs easier. Versioning is sometimes tricky to work into some ORM patterns. [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) tells you all about the [tips and tricks we've found to get Dolt working with an ORM](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-20-dolt-with-orms).

### Featured Images

Some of you may have noticed our blog article featured images have gotten a lot more professional. We hired a marketing lead: [James part two](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jamesl). Well, James has a process to get AI image generators to generate fun, consistent images. He describes his process in [this article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-16-agentic-art-direction). Here at DoltHub, we're embracing AI in as many aspects of our business as we can.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
