### Dolt for Beginners

The [Dolt for Beginners series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=beginners) is seven articles deep. The latest is on [branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-10-dolt-basics-branches/) but if you're a true beginner, you may want to start with [commits](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-03-dolt-basics-commits/). Check it out if you're a beginner or send it to beginners on your team getting started with Dolt. If you have a topic you think would be good to cover just reply to this email.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
