This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I apologize to all the folks who stopped by our booth at GDC who got to put a face to the author of these hilarious jokes. Universal disappointment in the face and the jokes.

### Dolt for Agentic Workflows

I think agentic workflows need version control to be successful. The reason that Cursor and GitHub Copilot work for users is because the objects the agents operate on are version controlled. [Dolt can help bring agentic workflows to other domains](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/). 

I want you to read [this article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/) so badly, I breaking with my recent tradition of not including images in this email. Plus, I'm really proud of this image.

Reply to this email if you have an agentic use case. I'd love to discuss my hypothesis with you.

### Doltgres Dump Progress

We finally got [a `pgdump` we downloaded from the internet to work](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-20-getting-pgdumps-working/)! We're working hard to improve [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. Compatibility with Postgres is important so we can finally [go Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-06-doltgres-beta/). We're still looking for example dumps so if you have one, let us know.

### Dolt for Beginners

The [Dolt for Beginners series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=beginners) is seven articles deep. The latest is on [branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-10-dolt-basics-branches/) but if you're a true beginner, you may want to start with [commits](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-03-dolt-basics-commits/). Check it out if you're a beginner or send it to beginners on your team getting started with Dolt. If you have a topic you think would be good to cover just reply to this email.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
