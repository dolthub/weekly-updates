This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm in Seattle this week. Half our engineering team is here, and I met with [Steve Yegge](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/) about [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), [Gas Town](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown), and his future plans. Dolt has made the difference in Gas Town's ability to scale past a handful of agents reliably. We've been saying Dolt is the database for AI, and now we have some proof. Stay tuned for more on this from Steve himself.

### Dolt in Git

One of the features Steve wanted for [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) was the ability to keep the Git sync functionality he had with the previous format. We brainstormed a little and came up with [a pretty interesting design](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-19-supporting-git-remotes-as-dolt-remotes/). We [announced the feature](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-13-announcing-git-remote-support-in-dolt/) Friday last week.  

The feature means you can use a GitHub repository as your Dolt remote. The remote is headless. You can't see the Dolt remote on GitHub but the database files are there on a hidden `ref`. Please try it. We plan on adding [a few features](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/10525) to make the Dolt remote visible on GitHub if you want.

### Building with the Claude SDK

One of the AI use cases we are excited about for Dolt is what we call ["Cursor for Everything"](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-19-cursor-for-everything/). If you want an agent panel in your application such that the agent can make changes safely and the user can see what the agent changed, moving the backend of your application to Dolt is a great way to achieve this.

We happen to have a great sample application to show you what this could look like: the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench). Last week we [released agent mode](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-09-introducing-agent-mode/) in the workbench. It's awesome. Please try it and show your friends.

We're not done talking about how we built it because we want you to move your application to Dolt and add agent mode, too. This week, [Eric](https://www.dolthub.com/tea#eric) talks about [the Claude Code SDK](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-16-building-with-claude-code-sdk) and how to use it in your Javascript application.

### Doltgres

With all this talk about AI, it's easy to forget we're building [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. We're in what I like to think of as compatibility hell. We're in the long tail of features Postgres supports that I frankly find weird. Features like the one Jason wrote about supporting this week: [Set Returning User Defined Functions](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-02-18-doltgres-returns-table-udf/). 

We have about 33% of our engineering team on Doltgres. We know you all want it. You can help by trying to put your `pgdump` in it and telling us what breaks, if anything.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
