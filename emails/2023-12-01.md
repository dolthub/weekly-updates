### Dolt Workbench Launch

It's launch week for us! We [released the Dolt Workbench](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-29-dolt-workbench/).

[Taylor](https://www.doilthub.com/team#taylor) has worked for years on making the SQL web workbench for [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com) and [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com) the best out there. After seeing the Hosted workbench in action, [Brian](https://www.doilthub.com/team#brian) insisted we [open source it](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench). 

You install the Dolt Workbench using Docker, hit it with your browser, and then connect to any MySQL-compatible database including Dolt. Unlike other workbenches that have Windows 95 era user interfaces, the Dolt Workbench greets you with a modern, interactive web interface you are accustomed to. We think it's the best open source workbench out there already.

Throw the [Dolt Workbench a star on GitHub](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench) if you get a chance. Next up we'll be adding Postgres and [Doltgres](https://www.doltgresql.com) support.

### Doltgres Correctness



### Dolt + Excel



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
