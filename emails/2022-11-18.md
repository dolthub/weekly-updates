This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Here in the good old U. S. of A, next week is Thanksgiving week. At DoltHub, we get Thursday and Friday off. Here is a live look at me trying to decide whether to send the email next week.

### Branch Permissions

This week we launched [branch permissions](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-14-introducing-branch-permissions/). Branch permissions are complementary to standard MySQL Users and Grants which we [began supporting in February](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-02-16-introducing-users-and-privileges/). Branch permissions allow you to configure which users can write to specific branches in your database in SQL server mode. It also allows for restricting branch creation in certain namespaces to certain users.

This feature only applies in SQL server mode. On the command line, we assume full administrative access. 

[Dolt](https://www.doltdb.com) is fast becoming a fully capable OLTP database. Branch permissions are the next step on that journey. It's time to start building your applications on top of Dolt.

### Hosted Dolt has Teams

Continuing with that theme, [Hosted Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-16-hosted-dolt-now-with-teams/) now has teams. We modeled Hosted Dolt teams after teams on DoltHub. Teams give Hosted Dolt users the ability to bucket permissions for certain groups of users. Hosted Dolt is getting a lot of investment. Backup restore, standby replication, configuration management, and clone from a Hosted instance are all in active development.

### Dolt is Easy

This week a customer asked us to [get `as of` queries working on StarRocks](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/4707). As you can see from [the linked GitHub issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/4707), we spent a couple days getting StarRocks working. Working with StarRocks made us realize how easy Dolt is to use and install, as Steve Waldman says, "you get pretty instant gratification with Dolt".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You get pretty instant gratification with dolt. You don&#39;t need to (though you can) start up a database server. You can cd into your data directory and just query a dolt db from the command line. Give it a shot! Here are some fun examples: 2/</p>&mdash; Steve Randy Waldman (@interfluidity) <a href="https://twitter.com/interfluidity/status/1588324786920296448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Dolt is a single executable file, ie. program. You download the one for your OS and you run it. It just works. No Docker. No services. No configuration. Just run a program. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
