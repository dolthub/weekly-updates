This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

It was my 45th birthday on Monday. I'm not expecting birthday wishes. However, I am into birthday gifts. I have one thing I want, all of you to start a Dolt server and build something cool with it.

### Getting Started with Dolt Vectors

The hot hotness in database land is vectors. We [released Dolt support for vector indexes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-16-announcing-vector-indexes/) a couple weeks ago. Since vectors are new, I didn't know much about them. What are they? How do you make them? Why do you put them in your database? My [Getting Started with Dolt Vectors blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-06-getting-started-dolt-vectors/) answers these questions and walks you through a practical example. 

I read a bunch of vector content researching [this article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-06-getting-started-dolt-vectors/) and there are not many start from scratch examples out there showing how to generate vectors and their utility. I'm biased but if you're interested in how vectors are used, spend the 15 minutes reading [my article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-06-getting-started-dolt-vectors/). You can even clone [the example database](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/timsehn/vector_example) I created and play with them yourself.

### More root user changes

[Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) has been hard at work cleaning up how Dolt's root user works. A few weeks ago, he [announced that the Dolt root user would no longer disappear](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-15-root-superuser-change/), a behavior that frustrated many a Dolt user. This week, he announces [more changes to creating users on the Dolt command line](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-05-sql-server-removes-user-pass-args/). Long and short of the announcement is, use standard users and grants to control your Dolt users. The good news is, we think we've reached the logical stopping point here and this interface is now stable.

### Dolt for Beginners: Dolt Clone

We've been building Dolt for over six years now. We've been writing three blog articles a week for five years and five blog articles a week for almost a year. As we've produced more content, our articles tend to get pretty deep and expert focused. I'm aiming to change that with a new series: [Dolt For Beginners](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-03-dolt-basics-clone/).

The [second article in the series is on Dolt clone](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-03-dolt-basics-clone/). This article explains how you can find an interesting database on DoltHub and clone it locally to your machine. Dolt's the only database where you can do that and it's very cool if you ask me.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
