This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Mrs. Dolt and I are celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary on July 3. We're dropping the little Dolts off at their grandparents and continuing on a week long romantic getaway. No version controlled databases allowed. So I won't be gracing you with an email next week. 

### Dolt + Threekit
