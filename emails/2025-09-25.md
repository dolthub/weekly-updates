This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Sorry not sorry for all the agent talk lately. We're back to a good old-fashioned "Look at all the cool new Dolt features!" weekly update.

### Unit Tests for your Database

After improving [Dolt Continuous Integration (CI)](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-01-updates-to-ci/) for the database testing use case, we realized we wanted a simpler, easier to define testing interface. We settled on the `dolt_tests` system table and the `dolt_test_run()` table function. [Dolt Unit Tests were born](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-29-unit-testing-dolt-database/).  

Dolt Unit Tests are for fast, local testing. Dolt CI is for running complex workflows on DoltHub. Expect improvements to Dolt CI to integrate unit testing into DoltHub, especially on Pull Requests. Testing workflows are especially important [to help agents operate more effectively on your database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-06-agents-need-tests/).

### Conflict Resolution UI

We're continuing to improve our Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). This week, [released a conflict resolution user interface](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-02-resolving-conflicts-on-the-web/) on the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench). DoltHub and [DoltLab](https://www.doltlab.com) will soon follow with a similar UI. Conflict resolution is a tricky interface to get right. So, please try it out and let us know what you think.

### Vector Type Release

MariaDB and MySQL introduced a vector type. Previously, we [announced support for vector indexes in Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-16-announcing-vector-indexes/) but the indexes were built on JSON type columns. Using JSON made building vector indexes slow. This week, we adopted the MariaDB and MySQL standard and [implemented a vector type in Dolt](). The good news is this makes Dolt vector indexes of comparable speed to build to MariaDB.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
