This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I know you all are waiting to hear how Pearl Jam was. Very nostalgic. Still got it. I was not at [the show that set off the controversy](https://people.com/pearl-jam-frontman-eddie-vedder-slams-diabolical-lie-in-harrison-butker-controversial-commencement-speech-8651427). That was Las Vegas.

### Dolt works with Datadog

We're on a mission to show that [Dolt just works](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps) with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-17-dolt-datadog-dashboards/) is on [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), a popular monitoring and dashboarding tool.

[The blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-17-dolt-datadog-dashboards/) shows how you can set up Datadog to monitor your Dolt database, complete with custom Dolt icon. As [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) points out, that's the most important part. 

### DoltHub is SOC2 Compliant

We just passed our SOC2 audit. DoltHub is now SOC2 compliant. If you've been waiting to use [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com) until we had this certification, your wait is over.

I wrote about [the process of getting SOC2 compliant](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-22-soc2/) as our announcement if you are curious.

### Dolt + Scorewarrior

One of our early customers, Scorewarrior, partnered with us to [describe their video game configuration use case](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-20-dolt-scorewarrior/). Versioning video game configuration is a popular Dolt use case. If you're building a game, get those configuration files out of Git, into Dolt.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
