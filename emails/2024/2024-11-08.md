This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I've been in Austin since Wednesday at the [MLOps World Conference](https://mlopsworld.com/) with [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brianf), the person who demands weekly jokes. It will not surprise you that he still has no jokes to tell. 

### Doltgres Permissions

We're hard at work on the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt, [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql). In fact, if you look at the [Dolt release notes](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases), most [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) and [go-mysql-server](https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server) changes these days are to support Doltgres. This week, we hit a major milestone required for [our Beta release](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-06-doltgres-beta/). We [released Doltgres users and grants](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-07-doltgres-supports-users/). This unlocks Hosted Doltgres which will be coming in the next month or so. Doltgres is getting good enough to try so if you're waiting, now might be the time to give it a test drive.

### An Ooey GUI Guide to Dolt

Are you the type of developer that loathes the command line? You want to click buttons and fill in forms. A year ago, I would have told you, "You are reading the wrong email". But Dolt has come a long way and now you can use Dolt without ever opening a terminal! [This article explains how](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-04-dolt-guis/), highlighting [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com), [the Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench), and [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com). 

### Python MySQL Connector Works with Dolt

We started our [Works with Dolt series](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps) with ORMs and Frameworks. In Python, we focused on [SQLAlchemy](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-07-12-sql-alchemy-getting-started/) and [Django](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-31-dolt-django/). These high level tools are more interesting to write about but upon reflection (pun intended), we feel like we skipped a step. So, we're going back and doing Works with Dolt blogs on the standard connectors in each language. We started with [Java JDBC](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-11-dolt-with-jdbc/) and this week, we did [Python MySQL Connector](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-01-dolt-with-mysql-connector-in-python/). As a reminder, Dolt is fully MySQL-compatible so it just works like a MySQL database with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
