It's time to break out the HackerNews meme!

Well, not quite, but Zach's irreverent [4-chan Go Programmer article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-23-the-4-chan-go-programmer/) got to #2.

### Dolt for Data Engineers

Inspired by some of my conversations at Ai4 with folks on the analytics side of the data stack, I went back to one of our greatest hits, [my data quality control article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-23-data-quality-control/), and [got into some specifics](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-28-dolt-for-data-engineers/) about how Dolt can be used on the analytics side of the house. 

I suggest using Dolt as a [Data Staging Area](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-28-dolt-for-data-engineers/#the-data-staging-area) or to [version Control your Gold Tables](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-28-dolt-for-data-engineers/#version-controlled-gold-tables).

These are cool use cases. If you're a data engineer and are Dolt curious, let's work together to implement one or both of these ideas. Just respond to this email.

### Doltgres Indexes

We continue to invest heavily in [Doltgres](https://www.doltgres.com), the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. As we shifted our type comparison logic to be more Postgres-compatible, we broke index support in joins. This made joins really slow. 

As many of you know, we compare performance Dolt to MySQL and Doltgres to Postgres using [a standard suite of sysbench tests](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/latency). When indexes were broken, our join tests were over 1000X slower. It turns out indexes are really useful for query performance. Well, [we fixed indexes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-27-enhancing-index-support/) and now the index tests are down to a more reasonable 15X slower than Postgres. 

Overall, across all sysbench tests, Doltgres averages about 7X slower than Postgres, 3.5X on writes and 9X on reads. Our goal for the [Beta launch in Q1 2025](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-06-doltgres-beta/) is less than 5X. By comparison, Dolt is 30% slower than MySQL on the same test suite, so almost equal. We started out about 15X slower than MySQL so we can get there with Doltgres.

### Workspace Updates

We are chasing a Git feature, `dolt add -p`. This allows you to partially stage changes in your working set. [Neil](https://www.dolthub.com/team#neil) has been hard at work designing a SQL interface to do this because Dolt is SQL-first. This week, he [released a new set of `dolt_workspace_` system tables](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-29-workspace-updates/). These tables are really cool. They give you full visibility and control over uncommitted rows. Neil walks through a pretty cool use case in [his announcement blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-29-workspace-updates/). `dolt add -p` on the command line will soon follow.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
