This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm on vacation this week but that's not going to stop me from sending you all your favorite update of the week.

### Schema Overriding

One of the problems early Dolt customers had was using Dolt time travel features across schema changes. Most ORMs assume a static schema. So, if you wanted to access an older version of the data you had to keep knowledge of older schema versions around in your code. Even with [reflection in SQL Alchemy this was still a pain](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-07-12-sql-alchemy-getting-started/).

Our solution is a feature we call [schema overriding](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-22-schema-overriding/). This feature allows you to set a SQL session variable with a Dolt version and Dolt will then cast all queries to the schema in that version. 

This means if you added a column in the latest version but want to query an older version's data, you set the schema `dolt_override_schema` to `HEAD`. Then, any historical query like `select * from t as of old_branch` will contain the new column and the values will be `NULL`. This allows you to use the same code to access historical versions. Pretty nifty if you ask me.

### Open Data on DoltHub

[DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com) has some pretty cool [open databases](https://www.dolthub.com/discover). Until recently, we were doing a poor job of exposing them. We used a ranking formula heavily weighted in favor of last updated. 

We changed this and now we think [our new formula](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-25-database-ranking/) does a much better job surfacing the [best data on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/discover). If you want your database to rank highly, use [this blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-25-database-ranking/) as a how to guide.

Quick plug for `post-no-preference`, an early DoltHub adopter, whose [US stock market databases](https://www.dolthub.com/users/post-no-preference) are the best free databases of their kind on the internet.

### Dolt + KAPSARC

[KAPSARC chose DoltLab](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-26-dolt-kapsarc/) to add data versioning on their most important research datasets. These customer blogs are really fun to write and KAPSARC has been a great partner driving enterprise features into DoltLab.
