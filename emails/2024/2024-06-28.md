This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Mrs. Dolt and I are celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary on July 3. We're dropping the little Dolts off at their grandparents and continuing on a week long getaway, just the two of us. No version controlled databases allowed. So I won't be gracing you with an email next week. 

### Dolt + Threekit

We have another in our series on customer blogs that explain how companies use Dolt. This time it's [Threekit](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-24-dolt-threekit/) who used Dolt to add branch and merge to their 3D modeling application. Threekit has been a pleasure to work with and drove many useful innovations into Dolt including [Hosted Dolt supporting GCP](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-02-27-hosted-doltdb-gcp-launch/) and [Dolt Standby replication](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-10-19-standby-replication/).

### JSON for Polymorphic Data?

We're making big improvements to [the way Dolt stores JSON](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-12-announcing-json-improvements/). We think Dolt can be the best database to store JSON because of the way we chunk up large objects and our version control features. We're doing a lot of research on how people use JSON in databases so we can better tell this story. If you have a JSON use case in SQL or even MongoDB, please reply to this email so we can chat.

[Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) dove into [polymorphic data](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-25-polymorphic-associations/) which seems to fit the JSON model well, but came to the conclusion that using JSON in this case was..."it depends".

### Golang Channels

We have a new blog in our [Golang blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang). This time [Max](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) wrote about [three ways to think about channels](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-21-channel-three-ways/). This one went as high as #2 on HackerNews and a user wrote "Well written. Will recommend to all newcomers from other languages." If you get any praise in the comment section the content must be good. Everyone knows the comment section is for haters. So, if you missed it, give [this one](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-21-channel-three-ways/) a read.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
