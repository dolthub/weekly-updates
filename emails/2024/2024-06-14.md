This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Some of you may know this already. I am Canadian. Moreover, I spent the first ten years of my life in Edmonton, well, Fort Saskatchewan for you Albertans. This was prime Gretzky-era hockey and the mighty Oil are back in the Stanley Cup finals this week. I've been leaving a bit early to watch McDavid get stimied by that Panthers Goalie, who I will not name. Go Oilers! 

### New JSON Format

On the heels of announcing [Dolt could now merge JSON objects](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-16-announcing-json-merge/), we have another big improvement to Dolt's JSON support. [Dolt 1.40.0 has a new on disk format for JSON](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-12-announcing-json-improvements/) that allows for structural sharing of JSON chunks and fast indexing into those chunks. For JSON objects over 4KB, it's a must have. For large JSON objects, Dolt is faster than MySQL. 

We are set on the goal of making Dolt the best SQL database for JSON columns. We think versioning, shared storage, and fast access will get us there. If you are currently using another database to store large JSON objects, consider switching to Dolt.

### Dolt + FJA

We're getting an exciting array of customer use case blogs going: [Turbine](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-17-dolt-turbine/), [Aktify](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-10-01-dolt-aktify/), [Nautobot](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-11-19-dolt-nautobot/), [Flock Safety](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-07-dolt-flock/), [Kapsarc](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-26-dolt-kapsarc/), and [Scorewarrior](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-20-dolt-scorewarrior/). 

Our latest is [FJA](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-10-dolt-fja/) who white label Dolt in a configuration management application they ship to their customers. They use Dolt to provide version control functionality in their application. FJA is one of Dolt's earliest customers and their use case shows how Dolt makes adding version control to your application easy.

### Pandas Works with Dolt

We're on a mission to show that [Dolt just works](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps) with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-07-dolt-pandas-dataframes/) is on [Pandas Dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a popular Python data analysis and manipulation tool. 

Pandas is a bit up the stack from the SQL layer but the blog shows you how to read a Dolt SQL query into a Dataframe, write a Dataframe to a Dolt table, and then read a diff into a Dataframe to see what you changed. Dolt can be a valuable tool in data analysis when you are making changes. Versioning can save you a lot of time and energy understanding what changed, when, and by who.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
