This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

As is customary, this email should begin with a joke. But I'm feeling rather humorless because it rained here in LA this week. At least the office didn't leak.

### Replit vs Vercel

We are very interested in AI App Builders here at DoltHub. A couple weeks ago, [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) showed off how to use [Vercel v0 with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=vercel). This week, he shows how [Replit works with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-15-replit-works-with-dolt/) and compares the experience to Vercel v0. Spoiler: he preferred the Replit experience.

We think there is a natural partnership between Dolt and App Builders. Dolt can enable full stack feature branches, merges, and rollback in an App Builder with the proper integration. If you work at Vercel, Replit, or Lovable, or know someone who does, we'd love to talk to you. If you are building an App Builder, we'd love to partner with you from the start and even contribute engineering resources. Just reply to this email.

### Official MariaDB Client Support

MariaDB vends its own client libraries. Dolt is both MySQL and MariaDB-compatible so the MariaDB clients worked with Dolt for quite some time. However, we did not officially test, and thus support, the MariaDB connectors. That changed this week. We now [officially support the MariaDB client libraries](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-14-mariadb-client-support/) and we've added them to the [supported clients section of our documentation](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/supported-clients/clients).

### Open Crop and Soil Database

There's a lot of [open data on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/profile/discover). We don't talk about it much any more but open data sharing was the reason we built Dolt in the first place. A user reached out to me and asked me to [write an article about the crop and soil database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-16-crop-and-soil-database/) he shared. [The database](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/our-sci/crop_and_soil_dataset) was cool so I happily obliged. Throw it a star if you get a chance. If you have interesting open data you are sharing that you want me to blog about, just reply to this email.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
