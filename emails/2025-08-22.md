This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I have a new best friend. See you [Claude Code](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-10-claude-code-my-new-best-friend/). It's been fun but you're a gold digger. My new bestie, [Cursor Agent](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-15-cursor-agent-vs-claude-code/), gives me what I want for 1/10 the cost.

### My New Favorite Coding Agent

Jokes aside, Cursor [released a coding agent a couple weeks ago](https://cursor.com/blog/cli). I [previously tested the Cursor IDE in agent mode, along with Gemini, Codex, and Claude Code](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-15-best-coding-agent/). Claude Code was the clear winner, though it was quite expensive, clocking in at about $10/hour.

Using similar methodology, I [tested Cursor Agent](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-15-cursor-agent-vs-claude-code/) and it bested Claude Code on every dimension. Most importantly, it did this at about 1/10th the cost: $1/hour. Cursor Agent is the new coding agent champion. We switched over to it internally.

### Coding Agents Kinda Suck at Data Tasks 

Both [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian) and I have been hard at work experimenting with Coding Agents on data-oriented tasks. Brian has been working on [importing cocktail recipes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-18-agentic-datacollection-2/). I tried to use [the GitHub MCP in concert with the new Dolt MCP to import all our GitHub issues into Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-20-does-dolt-need-mcp/). 

We're starting to notice some common deficiencies in coding agents working with databases beyond [version control](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-05-cursor-database-branches/) and [tests](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-06-agents-need-tests/). Do any of you know of any data-oriented agents? Reply to this email if you do.

### Docker Compose

[Dustin](https://www.dolthub.com/team#dustin) is our resident Docker expert. He's writing a beginner's series on Docker. He started by explaining [Docker itself](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-22-a-beginners-guide-to-docker/). This week, he covered [Docker Compose](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-19-a-beginners-guide-to-docker-compose/), which is used to coordinate multiple containers. Next week, he will cover Docker Swarm which is used to manage containers across multiple servers. Stay tuned.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
