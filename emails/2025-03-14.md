This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I will be at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco next week. If you want to put a face to these hilarious jokes, come find our booth in the exhibition hall. 

### Introducing `dolt debug`

[Dolt has a new CLI command, `dolt debug`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-13-dolt-debug-cmd/). If you have a slow or incorrect SQL query you want profiled, you pass it into this command with the `-q` command. The [release blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-13-dolt-debug-cmd/) shows you how to use all the debug artifacts. But it's more likely you can just include those in your Dolt GitHub issue and have the Dolt team figure it out. 

### Deprecated Swiss Map

In March of 2023, we [released](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-28-swiss-map/) an [open source Golang implementation of Swiss Tables](https://github.com/dolthub/swiss). We used this implementation deep in Dolt's new storage engine to more efficiently allocate memory to large maps. 

Over time, the package got a lot of interest from the open source community and other implementations popped up, including [one from another database company, CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/swiss). Apparently, this family of packages attracted so much interest that the approach was integrated into standard [Golang maps as of Golang 1.24](https://go.dev/blog/swisstable). Our package was mentioned as inspiration in the release notes. What a win for open source!

So, last week we moved Dolt to the standard Golang map implementation and [archived our implementation](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-07-archiving-the-dolthub-swiss-github-repository/). Good night sweet prince.

### Dolt For Beginners

Check it out if your a beginner or send it to beginners on your team getting started with Dolt. If you have a topic you think would be good to cover just reply to this email.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
