This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

We're back after a week off for Thanksgiving in the USA. It's now firmly the holiday season. My gift to you is going to be terrible jokes for the next three weeks.

### Version Controlled SQL Workbenches

For regular readers, you know that we recently launched [a desktop version of the Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench). It's available in the [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolt-workbench/id6720702995?mt=12) and [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nq8lqph9vvh?hl=en-US&gl=US) App stores.

The Dolt Workbench doesn't just work with Dolt. It works with any MySQL or Postgres-compatible database. As we used it to connect to those, older databases, we realized that Dolt is just a better developer experience. So, [Taylor](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) [compared using the Dolt Workbench with Postgres and Doltgres for common SQL workflows](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-02-workbench-better-with-version-control/). The Dolt workflows are just plain better.

### Productionizing Dolt

After a customer request, we published a guide on how to [Productionize Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-27-productionizing-dolt/). You have to [add TLS](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-03-ssl-mode/), configure backups and replication, set up monitoring, and a number of other things.

Or you can just use [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com) and leave that all to us. We have [private deployments for AWS](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-21-hosted-private-deployments/) with GCP coming soon.

### Golang Generics

The latest in [our Golang Blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is about [Golang Generics](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-22-are-golang-generics-simple-or-incomplete-1/). This one generated a bit of hate on Reddit and lobst.ers so [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) also wrote [a follow up](). The internet is awesome.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
