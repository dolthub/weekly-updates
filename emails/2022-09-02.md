This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub.

[Why did we call our database Dolt?](https://docs.dolthub.com/other/faq#why-is-it-called-dolt-are-you-calling-me-dumb) Git [means idiot in British slang](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Git). So, we needed a word that meant idiot, that started with 'D' for data, was not taken in the standard command line lexicon, and that was short enough to type.

### Character Sets and Collations

One of the more boring and confusing features of databases launched this week, [character sets and collations](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-29-finally-adding-collations/). I'm not going to lie, I didn't even know what a collation was until we started building [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt). It's a sort order. We haven't implemented every character set and collation. you can see which ones Dolt supports by running `SHOW CHARACTER SET`.

```
% dolt sql -q "show character set"
+---------+-----------------------+--------------------+--------+
| Charset | Description           | Default collation  | Maxlen |
+---------+-----------------------+--------------------+--------+
| ascii   | US ASCII              | ascii_general_ci   | 1      |
| binary  | Binary pseudo charset | binary             | 1      |
| latin1  | cp1252 West European  | latin1_swedish_ci  | 1      |
| utf16   | UTF-16 Unicode        | utf16_general_ci   | 4      |
| utf32   | UTF-32 Unicode        | utf32_general_ci   | 4      |
| utf8mb3 | UTF-8 Unicode         | utf8mb3_general_ci | 3      |
| utf8mb4 | UTF-8 Unicode         | utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci | 4      |
+---------+-----------------------+--------------------+--------+
```

If we don't support the one you want, we [built a clever way to make them](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-29-finally-adding-collations/) so we can add one in about an hour. [Just ask](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues).

### Hosted Dolt Backups

[Automated backups](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-31-hosted-backups/) launched this week following the [Database UI](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-24-hosted-sql-workbench/) last week. We are investing a lot in [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com/). High Availability, replication and automated failover, and a writable database UI including Pull Requests is coming in the next couple months. This already compelling product for building Dolt backed applications is going to get even better.

### Hiring for Seattle Office

[Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) and [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) are the founding members of the Seattle office. [Max](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) is likely moving up there in the fall. We're looking for a few more people to fill the space.
