This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Zach made [a whole blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-24-alternate-product-names/) this week of jokes about renaming Dolt so I'm deferring to him. We're not renaming Dolt but if we did my vote would be OurSQL because Dolt is the easy to share database.

### What's up with this email?

For those of you that are new, I write this email weekly. It's actually [me](https://www.dolthub.com/team#tim). You can reply to it if you want to chat about Dolt.

I open the email with a joke which is a policy I hate. Then, I tend to focus on things that are new for the week, usually highlighting our recent blog posts. We consistently publish three blogs a week so you get a lot of content from us. This email is a great way to get the highlights of what we're up to here at Dolt and dive deeper if something interests you. We beg you to not just stay in touch but to use Dolt or tell us what you are waiting for!

Next week we have a big announcement so you'll want to open that email.

### Guide to AWS Remotes

Dolt supports [remotes](https://docs.dolthub.com/concepts/dolt/git/remotes) just like Git. You clone, push, pull, and fetch from a remote. Remotes are used as a distributed collaboration and backup mechanism. We recommend [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com) or [DoltLab](https://www.doltlab.com) as the most full-featured remote options. But we also support AWS, GCP, self-hosted, and file system-based remotes.

[Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron) wrote [a cookbook on how to work with AWS remotes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-26-working-with-aws-remotes/). There's a lot of IAM and configuration that goes into making them work. This blog will show you how.

### Open Hospital Price Data Project Update

We continue to grind on the [hospital price transparency problem](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-21-open-source-hospital-price-transparency-3/). We are making our fourth attempt to collect prices from hospital charge masters after running through the [trillions of prices](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-02-a-trillion-prices/) in the insurance company data dump. The goal is to see how much the data lines up to judge it's accuracy.

We think Dolt is the only way an open data project like this could happen. We have data bounty hunters from all over the world collaborating with hospital pricing experts that aren't as data literate through [pull requests](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/transparency-in-pricing) and on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe). It's inspiring for us to see. Imagine what Dolt could do for you and your team.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.

--Tim
