This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

[Data Bounties are no more](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-18-bye-bye-bounties/). As a final act, we just deleted the `#data-bounties` Discord channel. Thanks to all the bounty hunters who participated. You join the not so long list in my mind of bounty hunters: Boba Fett and Dog the Bounty Hunter.

### We love Discord

Here at DoltHub, we've been on Discord for internal and external chat [for a long time](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-26-discord/). We love it. We end every blog with a call to action to [talk to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe).

This week, [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) wrote about [his experience administering our Discord](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-22-running-open-source-discord/). We highly recommend moving your internal chat to Discord and then encouraging your users to come hang out with you there. The live interaction with users is inspiring. 

### Dolt works with Knex

We're on a mission to show that Dolt just works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, the spotlight is on Javascript and the [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) framework. [Taylor](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) wrote a [Getting Started blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-27-dolt-and-knexjs/) complete with [sample code](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-knexjs-example/blob/main/index.js) to get you Javascript users going quickly with Dolt. We have a number of customers using Knex to connect to Dolt and power their front end applications.

### Strange Python `autocommit` Behavior

A number of Dolt users have been tripped up by Python's strange choice to have `autocommit` off by default. I dug into this and [wrote a blog about it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-25-python-autocommit/). The blog also details, complete with sample code, how to work with `autocommit` on and off. It even includes a connection pool example. The Python MySQL connector has a built-in connection pool.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
