This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I am back in my mother country, Canada, this week visiting my parents. Don't question my dedication to these weekly emails. I got this. That said, I'm going to keep it brief.

### Have Postgres. Want Dolt.

The people keep asking for a Postgres-flavored version of Dolt. We haven't updated you all on our plans in over a year. [Here's an update](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-07-14-postgres-dolt-2023/)

The verdict is we are starting on a Postgres-flavored Dolt soon and we want your feedback on the couple of options we have. Let us know what you want.

### Hosted Dolt comes to Europe

We [launched Hosted Dolt in an AWS and GCP region in Europe](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-07-17-hosted-dolt-launches-european-support/) last week. We see a lot of demand for Dolt from Europe and these regions will better serve those customers. We can launch Hosted Dolt in a region in about a day so if you would like a new region, just let us know.

### Merge Improvements

Dolt is the only SQL database with branches and merges. We [continue to make merge improvements](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-07-19-three-way-diff-merge/), both in correctness and performance. [This blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-07-19-three-way-diff-merge/) summarizes some of our recent improvements.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
