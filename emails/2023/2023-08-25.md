This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Just a reminder this week [that Fireship exists and he's funnier and more daring than me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb2AvF8XzII&t=128s).

### Pull Requests in Your App

The core Dolt early adopter [use cases](https://docs.dolthub.com/introduction/use-cases) are starting to form. People tend to use Dolt for one of three things:

1. Dolt as a feature store for an ML pipeline.
2. Dolt as the database for an app that needs pull requests.
3. Dolt and DoltHub as a replacement for a heavily edited spreadsheet.

In service of (2), [Taylor](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) published [a blog on making a pull request workflow using React](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-08-18-design-pull-request-workflow/), complete with [sample code](https://github.com/dolthub/react-graphql-dolt-sample-app). Taylor has built full stack pull request implementations for both DoltHub and the Hosted Dolt workbench. She's the expert here. Use her example to add pull requests to your React application.

### Works with Dolt: XCA

We are out to prove to the world that Dolt "just works" with your favorite tools. In service of this mission, [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) published [a blog on how XCA, a popular key and certificate management tool, works with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-08-21-xca-on-dolt/). Jason even shows how you can find and rollback a bad delete using Dolt.

To get this one to work we needed to [add support for ANSI quote mode to Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/pull/1915). This gives you an idea of where Dolt is as far as MySQL compatibility goes. We're [99.9%](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/correctness) there! If you've been waiting to try Dolt for it to "just work", it's safe to stop waiting and try it.

### Dolt for Better Database Testing

[Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian) built [a robot bartender backed by Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-05-17-dolt-powered-bartender/). In a blog this week, he describes [how he used Dolt's powerful rollback capabilities to more efficiently test it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-08-23-go-testing-using-dolt/). We use [the same approach](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-06-10-enginetest-perf/) to test Dolt itself.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
