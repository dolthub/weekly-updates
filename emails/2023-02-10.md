This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This week, we had [an iconic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb2AvF8XzII&t=128s) feature us as one of the 15 future databases. Thanks [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)! For this week's joke, I'm just going to ask [you watch the first 5 seconds of the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb2AvF8XzII&t=128s). Fireship is funnier and more daring than I could ever be in this email.

### Dolt for Backups



### Dolt for Game Development



### Semi and Anti Join Support



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
