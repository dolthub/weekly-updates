This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm writing this at 11:51AM PST on Friday. The email usually goes out at noon. I'm getting really busy. Things are going really well over here at DoltHub. Agents are hot. Dolt is [the database for agents](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-08-agentic-ai-three-pillars/). Tell your friends.

### v0 Works with Dolt

Speaking of agents, we think Dolt naturally fits as the database for "app builders": [Vercel v0](https://v0.app/), [Replit](https://replit.com/), or [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/). [Neon](https://neon.com/) is the default database for Vercel v0 because v0 needed branches. We think [Neon has forks not branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-18-database-branches/#neon). But, we agree v0 and all app builders need branches. If you work at Vercel, just reply! Same goes for Replit or Lovable.

Anyway, Vercel v0 works pretty well building an app that leverages Dolt's unique versioning features. [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) used [v0 to build an versioned inventory management application](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-01-vercel-v0-works-with-dolt/). We have more coming in this space so stay tuned if you are interested.

### Testing Data

The last few months, we've been buffing out Dolt's data testing capabilities. [Neil](https://www.dolthub.com/team#neil) has recently taken the lead on this initiative. He started with writing a [Dolt Testing State of the Union](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-02-data-testing-with-dolt/). This is a good introduction if you're thinking "what the heck is data testing and why does it matter?" 

### Golang Green Tea Garbage Collector

The latest in [our Golang Blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is about [Golang's Experimental Gree Tea Garbage Collector](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-12-go-channels-for-period-mismatch/). [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) tries the new garbage collector with Dolt, shows the results, and ultimately ends up disappointed that it seems worse than the current default Golang garbage collector.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
