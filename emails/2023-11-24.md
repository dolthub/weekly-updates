This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This week is Thanksgiving week in the US. A holiday is not going to stop me from sending my weekly email. But I'm giving thanks for not having to come up with a joke this week. 

### Dolt Reflog



### Costing Index Scans



### Decentralized Databases



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
