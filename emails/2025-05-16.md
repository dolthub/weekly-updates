This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

For those of you that are new, there is supposed to be a joke here. Early on, I got tricked into writing a joke per week by [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brianf), our sales person. It's a source of ongoing trauma in our relationship.

### SHOW in Doltgres

Dolt is modeled on MySQL. For all the hype around Postgres, and all [the anti-hype](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-14-is-mysql-dying/) around MySQL, we still prefer MySQL SQL. One of the reasons is `SHOW` statements. The equivalents exist in `psql`, hidden behind `\d`, but not in Postgres itself. So, for [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), our Postgres-compatible version of Dolt, we just [decided to add them](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-13-show-statements-doltgres/). Doltgres is showing off.

### `go:generate`

The latest in [our Golang Blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is about [`go:generate`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-09-go-generate/). [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) first explains the origins of `go:generate` and then explains [some ways we use it in Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-09-go-generate/#go-generate-in-the-wild).

### Column Tags

Did you know that Dolt has a hidden field for each column in your tables called a column tag? Probably not because we have never talked about them...[until now](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-15-column-tags/). Column tags are used to make sure Dolt does not fork storage on column renames but they have caused a bunch of problems over the years. [This article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-15-column-tags/) tells their story and is also a how to guide on what to do if you get a column tag conflict.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
