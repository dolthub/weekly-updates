### We love Discord

Here at DoltHub, we've been on Discord for internal and external chat [for a long time](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-26-discord/). We love it. We ened every blog with a call to action to [talk to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe).

This week, [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) wrote about [his experience administering our Discord](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-22-running-open-source-discord/). We highly recommend moving your internal chat to Discord and the encouraging your users to come hang out with you there. The interaction with users is inspiring. 

### Dolt works with Knex



### Strange Python `autocommit` Behavior



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
