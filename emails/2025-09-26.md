This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm bad at jokes and marketing. I think these two facts are related. If you know someone who can help me out with both, [we're hiring](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4299619875/).

### Developing an AI Agent

There's not much content on the internet on how to build an AI agent from scratch. [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian) has spent the past month working on a Dolt agent (codename d00lt: double-O Dolt) that we hope will be better at data-oriented tasks. He learned a lot about how to build an agent and he [shares some basics in his latest article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-19-agentic-development/). This is a really great read if you are interested in how agents like Claude Code and Cursor work underneath the covers.

### Dolt Tests in the Workbench

One feature we're really excited about is [Dolt Unit Tests](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-29-unit-testing-dolt-database/). Dolt Unit Tests allow you to make, store, and run SQL queries and test assertions about your schema and data. These tests are stored in the database itself. 

We are especially excited about this feature for agentic workflows. [Agents need tests](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-06-agents-need-tests/) to work for longer and generate better output. Because Dolt Unit Tests are stored in the database, they are cloned along with the schema and data allowing [agents to operate on a clone](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-25-agents-need-clones/).

This week, we released a new version of the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench) that has an easy-to-use user interface for defining and running Dolt Unit Tests. [Eric](https://www.dolthub.com/team#eric) goes into detail in [his latest article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-23-dolt-tests-in-workbench/).

### UC Berkeley CS Thinks Agents Need Branches

The world is starting to realize that agents need database branches. We [wrote about it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/) first. Then, [Cursor talked about it on Lex Fridman](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-05-cursor-database-branches/). Now, in a newly published paper called ["Supporting Our AI Overlords: Redesigning Data Systems to be Agent-First"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00997) by the UC Berkeley CS department, the authors seem to be asking for Dolt's product specification. I [wrote a response](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-24-berkeley-cs-agents-need-branches/). 

Unfortunately, the authors of this paper did not seem to know about Dolt. Spread the word. A version controlled database exists and it's great for agentic workflows.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
