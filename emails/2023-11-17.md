### Analyzer Stats

Before this week's [release of analyzer statistics](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-15-index-statistics/), Dolt sometimes didn't know which order to join tables in. This resulted in a whole class of slow joins. "I ran this join on MySQL and it took 20ms. In Dolt, it took 8s. What's Up?" This was because Dolt only considered the size of the tables, not the size of the tables post filter. A customer could work around this with a [join hint](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/sql-support/miscellaneous#join-hints) but other databases like Postgres and MySQL are fast without hints.

Well, now Dolt can be fast without a hint as long as you run `ANALYZE TABLE` before you run the join query. This query creates histograms of the shape of the indexed data in the table called analyzer statistics. [Max's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) blog article, [goes into great detail on how this works with examples]((https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-15-index-statistics/). Next step is to run `ANALYZE TABLE` automatically in the background so you don't have to. Stay tuned.
