### CALL ... AS OF

We think Dolt can be the best database for stored procedures. Stored procedures are code stored in your database. Most engineers think versioning code is a must. So versioning the code in your stored procedures makes a lot of sense. 

In service of the above, this week [we announced the release of `CALL...AS OF`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-18-unlocking-time-travel/). For those of you that don't know, you can [SELECT AS OF branch, commit, or even timestamp](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/querying-history#querying-past-snapshots-with-as-of). It's on of the most powerful features of Dolt allowing you to time travel between different versions of your Dolt database in a single query. For instance, you can [rollback a specific column to a commit using an update join with as of](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-23-dolt-rollback-options/#partial-rollback-using-sql).

This release extends that functionality to stored procedures. You can have an old version of a stored procedure operate on current data or the current version of a stored procedure operate on an old version of the data. Read [the release blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-18-unlocking-time-travel/) to find out more.
