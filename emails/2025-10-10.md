This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I spent most of the week in Austin, Texas at the MLOps conference. Thanks to all those who stopped by our booth. Last year we pitched Dolt as a feature store. This year we pitched Dolt as the database for agents. A lot can change in a year!

### Data Import Agent

We've been working on [our own Dolt data import agent](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-09-data-import-agent/). We noticed coding agents weren't very good at data scraping and import tasks. We had some hypotheses we wanted to test to see if we could build a more purpose built agent. 

So, test we did! [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian) spent the past month or so building a data import agent and published [a detailed article about how it works](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-09-data-import-agent/). Reply to this email if you want help Beta test it. Moreover, if you are curious about how to build an agent, [Brian's article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-09-data-import-agent/) is the most detailed and practical explainer I've read on the topic.

### Nonlocal Tables

Dolt users have long wanted unversioned tables mixed with their versioned tables. We had [dolt_ignore](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-system-tables#dolt_ignore) for a couple years for this purpose. But, ignored tables are local to a branch. Some users wanted unversioned tables global to all branches for use cases like a shared users table or a table to write log-like data.

This week, we released [nonlocal tables](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-06-nonlocal-tables/) to fill some of these use cases. Nonlocal tables are available on all branches and are unversioned. There's a few gotchas around foreign keys and we have some upgrades in the works to better support foreign key use cases. But, for simple cases, nonlocal tables will act like a table every branch can see and update.

### Better Diff Views in Dolt Workbench

If you haven't tried the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench), now is the time. It's available in the [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolt-workbench/id6720702995?mt=12) or [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nq8lqph9vvh?hl=en-us&gl=US) app stores or you can download it from [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench).

We're investing heavily in this interface because it's the most information dense, performant way to show off Dolt features. A couple weeks ago, [we announced a Dolt test interface](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-23-dolt-tests-in-workbench/). This week, [we launched a better diff view](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-08-see-what-changed-in-workbench/) to see what is changed in your working set. More improvements are coming.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
