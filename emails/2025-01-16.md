This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

It's been a busy, exciting week here at DoltHub. We were [introduced to Gas Town](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-15-a-day-in-gas-town/) which I'll get to later. Gas Town's name prompted a number of flatulence-based jokes like [this one from LinkedIn]( https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417361390446800896?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7417361390446800896%2C7417369952275312640%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287417369952275312640%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7417361390446800896%29): "My wife says we already have Gas Town in our house". I assure you Gas Town is named after Mad Max not farts.

### Gas Town and Beads

Have you ever thought "I wish I had 100 Claude Codes"? There's a new coding agent for you called [Gas Town](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-15-a-day-in-gas-town/). Gas Town looks like Claude Code but is really an agent orchestrator. You talk to an agent called the "Mayor" and that Mayor spins up many other agents to accomplish tasks at an insane throughput. Using Gas Town is like using an agent is the YOLOest of YOLO mode. It's exciting and terrifying at the same time. [My article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-15-a-day-in-gas-town/) gives you a tour. 

Gas Town is from the same author and built on top of another open source project called [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads). Beads is an agentic memory system that you can use without using Gas Town. The cool thing is [Beads is migrating to Dolt](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/steveyegge_a-day-in-gas-town-activity-7417434886778675200-1O4f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAoc2BwBZ7zFwpi1NwqsxK_jyrvbg_YsJ7I). [Dolt makes Beads tasks easier to write, manage, and control](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-15-a-day-in-gas-town/#can-dolt-help-beads).

We think Beads is an early case of [traditionally human scale writes becoming machine scale with AI](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-09-ai-database/#more-writes). Dolt can really help coordinate long-running, untrusted writes much like Git and GitHub do for code.

### Agents Need Branches: Andy Pavlo Edition

[Andy Pavlo joined](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2026/01/2025-databases-retrospective.html) the chorus of luminaries who have noticed agents need branches. He didn't mention Dolt even though we're pretty sure he knows about us. Maybe he forgot? 

Anyway, here's [our response](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-12-andy-pavlo-agents-need-branches/). We continue to assert that Dolt is the [only SQL database with true branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-18-database-branches/). If you know Andy, send him a link to [our article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-12-andy-pavlo-agents-need-branches/).

### DoltCash Part Deux

Dolt allows you to build [Cursor for Anything](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-19-cursor-for-everything/). To prove it to you for real, we're working on a Cursor for Accounting tool we call Dolt Cash. We [introduced it in late 2025](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-18-doltcash-vibe-accounting-built-on-claude-gnucash-and-dolt/) but we've made some progress since. [Read Dustin's latest](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-01-14-doltcash-part-two-still-vibing/) for more details.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
