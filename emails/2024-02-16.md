### Dolt + Rails

We're on a mission to show that Dolt just works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-02-09-dolt-ruby-on-rails/) is on [Ruby On Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), a popular Ruby-based website builder with a built-in ORM.

We've covered how other website builders work with Dolt recently including [Laravel](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-08-dolt-laravel/) and [Django](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-31-dolt-django/). If you have any others, you'd like to see, just reply to this email. They are fun blogs for me to write because I get to write some sample code.

### Upgrading Your Hosted Instance

[Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com) got some upgrades recently. You can now add and remove replicas to your deployment, upgrade the size of your primary instance, and restart a stopped deployment from a backup. Hosted Dolt is the easiest way to run Dolt in production. Get started with our trial instance at $50/month.

### Doltgres Types



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
