This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

For those of you that are new here, [Dolt is named after Git](https://docs.dolthub.com/other/faq#why-is-it-called-dolt-are-you-calling-me-dumb). Git means something close to idiot in British slang So, we needed a word that meant idiot, started with "d" for data, was short enough to type on the command-line, and was not taken in the standard command line lexicon. So, Dolt it was.

### Customer Per Branch

A common Dolt usage pattern we see emerging for multi-tenant applications is what we call ["customer per branch"](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-08-customer-per-branch/). Schema and domain data is stored on the `main` branch. Each customer gets there own branch for their customer-specific data. This data isolation simplifies tables and is much more fault tolerant. Schema migrations in particular, are managed via merges from `main` so you can incrementally roll them out. [This article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-08-customer-per-branch/) dives into more detail if you are interested in this pattern.

### Better Stored Procedures

We've long thought [Dolt was the best database for heavy use of stored procedures](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-18-unlocking-time-travel/). Stored procedures are code and we've all unanimously conceded that all code should be version controlled. Dolt is the only SQL database with native version control. Thus, Dolt is the only database that can version your stored procedure code natively.

This week, [Dolt stored procedure support got a major upgrade](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-07-stored-procedures-v2/). A bunch of syntax that was unsupported, like DDL statements now work. This involved rewriting our parsing and execution logic. We've fairly certain it is 100% backwards-compatible, but it's a fairly major change so if you run into any issues after upgrading to 1.53.0, please [cut an issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues).

### Are Coding Agents One Innovation Away?

As you all may know, we've been experimenting with generative AI here at DoltHub. [It's not going great](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-23-coding-agents-suck-too/). This week I weigh in with [my take](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-05-coding-agents-need-a-page-rank/) which is coding agents seem to be one innovation away just like web search was pre-Google. [My article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-05-coding-agents-need-a-page-rank/) is a bit of a trip down memory lane so it was fun to write. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
