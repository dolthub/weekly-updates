This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

DoltHub HQ is still reeling from the effects of the Los Angeles fires. Almost everyone in LA knows someone impacted and we are no different. Thanks for all the kind words. We're chugging along as best we can trying to build you all the world's first version controlled database.

### Vectors!

[As promised](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-26-plan-for-vectors/), we [launched Vector support in Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-16-announcing-vector-indexes/) this week. Vectors in databases are useful in a few use cases but one really shines lately. In generative artificial intelligence vector indexes are useful for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflows. Anyone who is reading this email is likely familiar with how hot generative AI is right now. Dolt is hopping on the wave!

Besides being the one of the few SQL databases to support vectors, Dolt provides the unique capability to query vector search results historically. Last week's generated results were better? Roll back quickly using Dolt's versioning features. Then investigate what happened to your vector data in the past week. Dolt brings standard Git workflows to the SQL database and now vector search.

### `root` User Changes 

Dolt treated the `root` superuser that was created by default differently than MySQL. This [confused lots of users](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/5759). In the latest Dolt release, [we've made some changes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-15-root-superuser-change/) to the `root` user behavior that we think more closely align with MySQL's behavior. Most importantly, the `root` user now sticks around after a Dolt SQL server restart.
