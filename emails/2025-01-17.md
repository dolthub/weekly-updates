This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

DoltHub HQ is still reeling from the effects of the Los Angeles fires. Almost everyone in LA knows someone impacted and we are no different. Thanks for all the kind words. We're chugging along as best we can trying to build you all the world's first version controlled database.

### Vectors!



### `root` User Changes 

Dolt treated the `root` superuser that wis created by default differently than MySQL. This [confused lots of users](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/5759). In the latest Dolt release, [we've made some changes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-15-root-superuser-change/) to the `root` user behavior that we think more closely align with MySQL's behavior. Most importantly, the `root` user now sticks around after a Dolt SQL server restart.
