This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I usually write the joke last. I managed to write a whole email without mentioning [Prolly Trees](https://docs.dolthub.com/architecture/storage-engine/prolly-tree). Or did I?

### We ❤️ Claude Code

I can write code again! Well, I can [supervise Claude Code writing code](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-10-claude-code-my-new-best-friend/). Close enough. I was able to submit 24 PRs across our open source projects in two weeks using Claude Code. I'm sold.

Neil also wrote about [using Claude Code to build a Battleship game](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-09-vibe-coding-with-claude/) on top of Dolt. Claude Code seems to know a lot about Dolt's SQL and version control interfaces.

### OIDC Support in DoltLab

For DoltLab Enterprise, we started supporting [Single Sign On via SAML](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-30-announcing-doltlab-enterprise/#single-sign-on). OIDC is a more modern Single Sign On protocol. This wee, we annouced support for [OIDC in DoltLab enterprise](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-11-announcing-doltlab-enterprise-oidc-sso/). If you're looking for an on-premises Dolt remote with all the features of DoltHub, DoltLab Enterprise is for you.

### Doltgres Extension

We're still hard at work on [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. One of the coolest features of Postgres is extensions. We have a plan to support extensions in Doltgres but it's a bit involved. If you'd like to dive deep into how Postgres extensions work under the covers and how were, making them work in Dolt, [this article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-06-loading-native-extensions/) is for you. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
