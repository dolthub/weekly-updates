This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Welcome to the first email of 2023. For those of you that are new, the format is a joke followed by three updates. The running joke is that I hate writing the joke and Brian Fitzgerald makes me write it. Now that we're all caught up, the jokes will resume next week.

### ACID Transactions Beta Released

Dolt is nearing it's 1.0 release. One of the last steps is to make ACID transactions the default. Yesterday, we [released ACID transaction support in Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-04-acid-transactions/). You can enable them for your Dolt database by setting the `DOLT_ENABLE_CHUNK_JOURNAL=true` before you run `dolt sql-server`. Please try them out. 

Counterintuitively, ACID transactions improve write performance. Read [Andy's blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-04-acid-transactions/) to understand why.

### Dolt + Retool

[Dhruv](https://www.dolthub.com/team#dhruv) wrote [a blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-03-superpower-retool-with-dolt/) about how to use Dolt with [Retool](https://retool.com/), a popular low-code application builder. With Dolt, you can use a Retool app to make peer-reviewed edits to your production database without any code. [Dhruv's blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-03-superpower-retool-with-dolt/) walks through the steps and queries required to get Retool and Hosted Dolt working together.

### Changing DoltHub Pro

[DoltHub Pro](https://www.dolthub.com/pricing) allows you to create private repositories on DoltHub. It costs $50/month for unlimited users up to 100GB. Each additional 10GB is $1/month. In the next couple weeks, we're lowering the free tier of DoltHub Pro to 100Mb from 1GB. We found that the free tier was a bit too generous. If you are effected by this change you'll receive an email. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
