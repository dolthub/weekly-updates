This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Welcome to the first email of 2023. For those of you that are new, the format is a joke followed by three updates. The running joke is that I hate writing the joke and Brian Fitzgerald makes me write one. Now that we're all caught up, the jokes will resume next week.

### ACID Transactions Beta Released

Dolt is nearing it's 1.0 release. One of the last steps is to make ACID transactions the default. Yesterday, we [released ACID transaction support in Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-04-acid-transactions/). You can enable them for your Dolt database by setting the `DOLT_ENABLE_CHUNK_JOURNAL=true` before you run `dolt sql-server`. Please try them out. 

Counterintuitively, ACID transactions improve write performance. Read [Andy's blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-04-acid-transactions/) to understand why.

### Dolt + Retool



### Changing DoltHub Pro



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
