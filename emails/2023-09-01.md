This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

In the US and Canada, this weekend is [Labor Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Day). As the part owner of a business, I refuse to observe this holiday until there is a Capital Day. [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) is quick to remind me that every other day is Capital Day, difficult to refute.
