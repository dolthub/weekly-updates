This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I know what you all are thinking. Where was my Friday Tim email? I hope he's ok. Well, I was on vacation last week so you get a Monday email instead of a Friday email. I appreciate all the concern even though I did not get a single "Are you ok?" email. 

### ChatGPT integration



### Dolt Replica from AWS RDS



### Powering AWS Amplify with Dolt



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
