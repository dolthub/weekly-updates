This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

We had a very vocal Rustacean come by our Discord a couple weeks ago. I made the case that if you've run `cargo`, you are a Rustacean. 

I like it when communities have names. Ours is easy. We're just Dolts.

### Postgres Update

Dolt now work with the `mysql_fdw`

### New System Table

`dolt_column_diff`. Stephanie's first blog.

### Dolt and SQLAlchemy



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
