This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

We had a very vocal Rustacean come by our Discord a couple weeks ago. I made the case that if you've run `cargo`, you are a Rustacean. A baby Rustacean, but a Rustacean nonetheless.

I like it when communities have names. Ours is easy. We're just Dolts.

### Postgres Update

A few times a month, we get people showing up and saying they [wish Dolt was Postgres flavored](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/4840). If you're curious, we explained why Dolt is MySQL flavored in the first place [here](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-03-28-have-postgres-want-dolt/#why-is-dolt-mysql-flavored-anyway). We're making steady progress integrating better with Postgres and if enough people use and adopt the MySQL-flavored Dolt, we'll be able to afford to build and maintain ["Doltgres"](http://www.doltgresql.com).

This week, we [mocked server-side cursors in Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/vitess/pull/228) required by the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper (ie. `mysql_fdw`). Now, you can use Dolt in Postgres using the `mysql_fdw`. Here's [a blog explaining how](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-12-dolt-with-mysql_fdw/).

[![Postgres `mysql_fdw`](../images/dolt-mysqlfdw.png)](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-12-dolt-with-mysql_fdw/)

Our new issue is that the `mysql_fdw` does not support calling procedures which are [required to access some of Dolt's version control functionality](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures). We're discussing possible solutions to this.

### New System Table

We have a new system table! [`dolt_column_diff`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-10-dolt-column-diff/). Customers were asking for a view of their diffs between what tables changed, [`dolt_diff`]https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-system-tables#dolt_diff) and what rows changed []`dolt_diff_<tablename>`](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-system-tables#dolt_diff_usdtablename). This system table tells you which columns changed between commits.

This is [Stephanie's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#stephanie) first big feature and blog. [The blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-10-dolt-column-diff/) is really well done with a lot of interesting examples of how to use the new table. Give it a read.

### Dolt and SQLAlchemy

I published [a blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-12-dolt-sqlalchemy/) about how to use SQLAlchemy reflection to manage schema changes across history or branches more efficiently. SQLAlchemy reflection makes it pretty easy to access different schemas in Dolt. 

However, your application still needs to be aware of multiple schemas. We are discussing [a feature](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/5486) where we would pin the schema to a version and project tables across history to that schema. We think some applications want to version the data but only want to have to know about one version of the schema. If you want something like this for your use case, hit me with a reply to this email.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
