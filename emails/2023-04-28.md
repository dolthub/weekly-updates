This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Zach made [a whole blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-04-24-alternate-product-names/) this week of jokes about renaming Dolt so I'm deferring to him. We're not renaming Dolt but if we did my vote would be OurSQL because Dolt is the easy to share database. 

### What's up with this email?

### Open Hospital Price Data Project Update
