This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

DoltHub is safe from the [bank troubles this week](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/09/silicon-valley-bank-shoots-self-in-foot/). If we go out of business, we're going to do it the old fashioned way:

Speculating on NFTs
Mixing funds with DoltHedge
DC2 (Dolt Compute Cloud) by AWS
Building an oddly name database no one wants!

### Dolt 0.75.0

We had a big release this week! [Dolt 0.75.0](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/tag/v0.75.0). This is the last major release before Dolt 1.0. Upgrade now for write durability and performance improvements.

This release turns [the Dolt chunk journal](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-08-dolt-chunk-journal/) on by default. A few people have been testing it since [it was released behind a flag at the start of the year](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-04-acid-transactions/). The big win is write durability and write performance. Dolt is now under 2X slower than MySQL on the standard `sysbench` test suite.

Interestingly, architecturally, we always thought writes were going to be Dolt's issue because we do materially more work on a write than a traditional database. But right now, comparatively, [Dolt is much slower on the read path (2.3X MySQL) than the write path (1.3X MySQL)](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/latency). There's no architectural reason Dolt can't be as fast as MySQL on the read path. That's just slow code.

### Spatial Indexes

[Spatial Indexes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-03-spatial-indexes/) were released last night in [0.75.1](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/tag/v0.75.1). Dolt is ready for your spatial databases now. Dolt supports 90% of the spatial features in MySQL. Try it out and [let us know](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues) if we're missing something you need.

Dolt uses the Z-Ordering approach to indexes in order to version the index in storage. If you want a crazy deep dive into spatial indexing and how Z-ordered indexes fit into Prolly Trees, [read our announcement blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-03-spatial-indexes/). History independence is key.

### New Medical Price Bounty

Medical prices are becoming [Dolt's Linux](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-20-search-for-dolt-linux/). We've been working with [the massive health insurance price dump](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-02-a-trillion-prices/) for months now. We're back at it, [this time collecting a set of prices for popular codes for only hospitals](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-prices-allpayers). We have a medium term plan that [you can read about here](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-6-open-source-hospital-price-transparency-2/). If you're waiting to participate in [DoltHub Data Bounty](https://www.dolthub.com/bounties), the next few are going to be fun and for a good cause. Now is the time to hop in.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
