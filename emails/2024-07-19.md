This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

As some of you may have noticed we've gone up five blogs per week from three. We have three people on vacation this week and one of them is [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach), our second most prolific blogger behind me. It seems like I've been writing all week to pick up the slack. So, the jokes aren't flowing this week.

### Prolly Trees for JSON 

The data structure that makes Dolt possible is called a [Prolly Tree](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-03-prolly-trees/), a content-addressed B-tree. We didn't invent Prolly Trees, the [Noms](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms) team did. But we made Prolly Trees production-ready. Prolly Trees are the core data structure in Dolt. We use them [everywhere](https://docs.dolthub.com/architecture/storage-engine). Now, we use them in one more place.

[Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) built a clever way to [use Prolly Trees to index JSON columns](https:/www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-15-json-prolly-trees/) in Dolt. This give large JSON objects in Dolt some very useful properties, like structural sharing of storage, fast diff, and indexed lookups. Dolt is quickly becoming the best SQL database to store JSON. If you have a JSON use case, we'd love to hear about it.

### Lambdabats

We make heavy use of [Bash Automated Testing System aka BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) to test the Dolt command line. As with most testing systems, as the number of tests grew so did the time to run those tests. After many moons, this eventually frustrated [Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron) enough to throw some infrastructure at it. [Lambdabats was born](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-17-lambdabats/). Now, BATS tests run in minutes instead of hours.

Lambdabats is [open source](https://github.com/dolthub/lambdabats) and can be extended to run other systems with massive parallelism if there is interest. 

### Postgres vs MySQL Sysbench Latency

As many of you know, we measure Dolt and Doltgres query latency using a standard suite Sysbench tests. We compare the median latency to MySQL and Postgres respectively and [publish this comparison](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/latency) for every version of Dolt. This puts us in a good position to [compare MySQL vs Postgres query latency](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-16-mysql-postgres-sysbench-latency/). 

We were slightly surprised to find out MySQL was 2.3X slower than Postgres on our test suite. Dolt is only 1.7X slower than MySQL. Very few people worry about MySQL query latency and we think people should also stop worrying about Dolt query latency. Dolt is fast enough that most customers don't even notice the performance difference.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
