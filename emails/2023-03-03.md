This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

The [Fireship 15 Future Databases video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb2AvF8XzII) is over 270,000 views. All the jokes I could come up with were not PC enough to print. If you want to find one I committed and decided against [check the commit log](https://github.com/dolthub/weekly-updates/commits/main).

### Does `binlog` replication from MySQL make Dolt Change Data Capture?

As frequent readers of this email know, we [recently launched `binlog` replication from MySQL](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-02-17-binlog-replication-preview/). This is a big deal because you can get Dolt features without switching off MySQL. 

Honestly, if you're running MySQL, I'm not sure why you wouldn't run a Dolt replica just to mitigate [the bad administrator query situation](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-04-14-atlassian-outage-prevention/). Stop reading now, start a dolt sql-server and run:

```SQL
SET @@GLOBAL.SERVER_ID=1;
CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST='<prod mysql host>', SOURCE_USER='root', SOURCE_PASSWORD='<password>', SOURCE_PORT=3306;
START REPLICA;
```

It's that easy (sometimes). Each transaction commit becomes a Dolt commit.

Anyway, this feature makes Dolt an option for [Change Data Capture](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-01-change-data-capture/) on MySQL. I make the case in [this blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-01-change-data-capture/) and I also go over Airbyte and Debezium for good measure. If you like my search classics like [So you want Database Version Control?](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-09-17-database-version-control/) and [So you want Data Quality Control?](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-23-data-quality-control/), you'll probably like [So you want Change Data Capture?](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-01-change-data-capture/).

### Hosted Dolt now on Google Cloud

You can now deploy [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com/) to a Google Cloud instance. Some customers prefer Google Cloud over AWS, mostly because they want to colocate their Dolt instance with the rest of their infrastructure. We heard you and you [can now deploy Dolt on GCP](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-02-27-hosted-doltdb-gcp-launch/).

### Improved DoltHub API

If you've been automating against [DoltHub's](https://www.dolthub.com) or [DoltLab's](https://www.doltlab.com) "unofficial" GraphQL API, you can stop. We now have [an improved API](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-02-24-introducing-the-new-dolthub-api/) that supports creating, commenting on, and merging pull requests along with a few other common tasks. [Our documentation here](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolthub-api) is pretty good, especially [the cool API widget](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolthub-api/database#create-database), so stay in up-to-date there.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
