This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

No joke this week because I don't want to distract from our big announcement.

### DoltgreSQL is Here

We [released the Postgres version of Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-01-announcing-doltgresql/) this week, [DoltgreSQL](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), or Doltgres for short

We built Dolt to be MySQL compatible because [go-mysql-server](https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server) was the most expedient way to add SQL support to our pure Golang "Git for Data" project. But [the people wanted Postgres](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-07-14-postgres-dolt-2023/). We had to oblige.

Doltgres uses the same storage format and engine as Dolt but you connect with a Postgres client. It's about as compatible with Postgres as Dolt was with MySQL two years ago but it has current Dolt performance. Consider it experimental. [Dolt is 1.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-05-dolt-1-dot-0/) so we recommend it for anyone who can use a MySQL client to connect. But if you must have Postgres for some reason, Doltgres is for you.

Please [star the GitHub repo](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), try it out, and [cut issues](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql/issues) for any bugs you find or features you need. [Daylon](htttps://www.dolthub.com/team#daylon) iios dedicated to this project full time and [Zach](htttps://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) will be joining him soon. Depending on customer needs, we can dedicate more people. Please, let us know what you need.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
