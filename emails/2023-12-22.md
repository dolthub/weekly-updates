This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

For most people around the world, next week is a holiday week. So, this will be my last email of 2023. Wishing you and your a happy holidays.

### How fast is Doltgres?

Dolt is about [70% slower than MySQL, about twice as slow on reads and 30% slower on writes](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/latency). We've spent years perfecting these benchmarks and optimizing Dolt's performance against them. When we [mysteriously got faster against MySQL on Halloween](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-22-spooky-performance-regression-aws-ebs/), a [Christmas Miracle helped us fix it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-08-christmas-come-early-ebs-performance-regression-update/).

But how does Doltgres compare to Postgres and by proxy how does Postgres compare to MySQL? [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) tested this on Windows to get some [preliminary results](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-15-benchmarking-postgres-mysql-dolt/). Doltgres is about 8X slower than Postgres on reads and about 6X slower on writes. Postgres is much faster, 6X, than MySQL on the write path. We have some work to do on the Doltgres read path. 

As I said, These results are preliminary and once we have them nailed, we will publish them in the Doltgres release notes for each release.

### So you want a SQL Workbench?

Did you know the DoltHub user interface is available as an [open source SQL Workbench](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-20-sql-workbench/)? We call it the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench). It works with and MySQL compatible database and Postgres support will be added soon. [Taylor](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) did a [deep dive comparison](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-20-sql-workbench/) of all the SQL Workbenches out there and the Dolt Workbench has the most modern UI. Give it a test drive and throw it [a star on GitHub](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench) while you're at it.

### Merging Indexes

A user was using `post-no-preference` [open source stocks and options databases](https://www.dolthub.com/users/post-no-preference) and noticed adding an index was slow after a pull. That's not supposed to be that way. Dolt had [a bug](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/6951) and [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) fixed it and then [wrote about the feature](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-18-extending-shared-datasets/). 

Dolt's decentralized nature allows from some [pretty cool use cases around indexes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-12-18-extending-shared-datasets/). Share a database on DoltHub without indexes and allow your users to add indexes as they need them. As updates come in via pull, the user incrementally updates their index. No need for big shared indexes.

Until the new year. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
