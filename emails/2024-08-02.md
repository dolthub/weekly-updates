This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This week, specifically August 6, is DoltHub's six year anniversary. We've come a long way but we also have a long way to go. Thanks to all of you who are tracking our journey.

### Introducing `dolt archive`

[Neil](https:///www.dolthub.com/team#neil) has been grinding for months on a new storage format that offers up to 50% disk compression. Half the amount of disk for a Dolt database? Yes please. A beta version is [finally here](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-31-archive-beta/).

To try it, check the size of your database. Run `dolt gc`. Run `dolt archive`. Run `dolt gc` again. Check the disk space again. You should be pleasantly surprised. There is a caveat. For now, you won't be able to push an archived database. You can "unarchive" so it isn't a one way trip. We eventually want to make this the default format so as we gain confidence, we'll enable pushing and make new databases in this format. 

### Hosted Private Deployments

A potential downside of Hosted Dolt for some customers is that it deploys your database on the public internet. We've [built a deployment mode](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-26-hosted-instances-from-your-private-vpc/) for AWS instances that instead deploys your instance onto a private IP that you can hook into your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). We call this deployment mode Hosted Private Deployments. 

We don't have a user interface for this mode yet, but if you're interested in helping us test it out, we can make you one via our APIs. Just reply to this email if you want one.

### The History of DoltLab

[Dustin](https://www.dolthub.com/team#dustin) has been working hard all year to improve DoltLab. We think most Dolt users will eventually see the [benefit of having a remote](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-04-25-why-remotes/) and DoltLab will be a good option for people that want to keep data in their internal network. With the release of DoltLab 2.3.0, Dustin walks through [the history of DoltLab](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-01-doltlab-a-history-of-features/) and how we ended up with the product we have today. It's a fun read.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
