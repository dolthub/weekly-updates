This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I bet you were expecting a Halloween joke. Nope. I was desperate so I [used that one two weeks ago](https://github.com/dolthub/weekly-updates/blob/main/emails/2024-10-18.md). I'm drafting a Dolt to help me.

People are on to me. From user Joop on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gqr7K4VNKe).
