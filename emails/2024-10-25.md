### Automatic Table Statistics

In my [Dolt At Scale](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-21-dolt-at-scale/) article, I stressed the importance of turning on table statistics for large databases and teased an update to Dolt where table statistics would be collected automatically. Well that day came quickly, as we announced [table statistics are collected by default](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-24-automatic-stats/) in the latest Dolt. Table statistics make a big difference for proper join planning. 

### Git at Amazon

Here at DoltHub, a whopping five of the fifteen people who work here worked on the same team at Amazon, Builder Tools. I worked on  that team from 2003 to 2008. That's where I met [Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron), [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach), and [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason). [Neil](https://www.dolthub.com/team#neil) and I didn't cross paths, as he worked there a little later. The Builder Tools team is responsible for a system called Brazil which includes version control of source code. I'd say we gathered the right team to build the world's first version controlled database. 

Leveraging this experience, Neil wrote about [migrating Amazon from Perforce to Git](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-18-git-at-amazon/) and how that project effects the way he thinks about Dolt. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
