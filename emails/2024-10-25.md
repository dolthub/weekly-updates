This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm not sure about where you all are but in Santa Monica and Seattle everyone is sick. My wife is sick. My kids are sick. Half the office is sick. I've managed to avoid it so I can tell you all sick jokes.

### Hack Dolt. We Dare You!

We're confident Dolt has a tamper resistant storage architecture. A few weeks ago, we [announced the release of `dolt fsck`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-09-fsck-announce/), a utility to check whether the contents on disk match Dolt's committed hash values. We want to encourage the Dolt community to hack at Dolt trying to find edge cases where you can fool `fsck`. So, we [announced the Dolt corruption challenge](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-23-tamper-proof-challenge/). We're offering a bounty of $1,000 for each individual hack. See if you can break Dolt. It pays!

### Automatic Table Statistics

In my [Dolt At Scale](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-21-dolt-at-scale/) article, I stressed the importance of turning on table statistics for large databases and teased an update to Dolt where table statistics would be collected automatically. Well that day came quickly, as we announced [table statistics are collected by default](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-24-automatic-stats/) in the latest Dolt. Table statistics make a big difference for proper join planning, especially on large databases. 

### Git at Amazon

Here at DoltHub, a whopping five of the fifteen people who work here worked on the same team at Amazon, Builder Tools. I worked on  that team from 2003 to 2008. That's where I met [Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron), [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach), and [Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason). [Neil](https://www.dolthub.com/team#neil) and I didn't cross paths, as he worked there a little later. The Builder Tools team is responsible for a system called Brazil which includes version control of source code. I'd say we gathered the right team to build the world's first version controlled database. 

Leveraging this experience, Neil wrote about [migrating Amazon from Perforce to Git](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-18-git-at-amazon/) and how that project effects the way he thinks about Dolt. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
