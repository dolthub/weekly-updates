This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Some of you may have noticed we've gone up to five blog posts per week. No generative AI play here. They're all human written. We are just shouting at the internet until it listens.

### Dolt adds a cgo Dependency



### DoltLab: Getting started



### Shiny Works With Dolt



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
