This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm back and refreshed from my anniversary trip. Still married so that's a win. Back to the business of building the world's first version controlled database.

### Replicate a Branch to MySQL

For a while now, you've been able to [replicate your MySQL instance to Dolt](https://docs.dolthub.com/introduction/getting-started/versioned-mysql-replica). This gives you a commit log for your current MySQL on your Dolt replica. You can use this replica for powerful rollback capabilities.

Last week, we released replication is the opposite direction. You can now [replicate a Dolt branch to MySQL](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-05-binlog-source-preview/). You can use Dolt to MySQL replication to integrate with common tools like the change data capture tool, Debezium. Or, if you are read performance sensitive, you can serve a branched reads from a MySQL instance. Dolt is at [about parity with MySQL on writes, but about 2X slower on reads](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/latency), so this set up will approximate MySQL performance.

### Prisma Works with Dolt

We're on a mission to show that [Dolt just works](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps) with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-28-dolt-and-prisma/) is on [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a popular Typescript/Node.js ORM.

### Golang Generic Collection Types

We have a new blog in our [Golang blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang). This time [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) wrote about [writing Generic Collection Types](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-01-golang-generic-collections/). This is a problem he struggled with himself where he identified some missing documentation. [This blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-01-golang-generic-collections/) fills that gap. For the good of the Golang community, he hopes the blog will save fellow Golang developers with the same issue the hours he spent puzzling through the problem.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
