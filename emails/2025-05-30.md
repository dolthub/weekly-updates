This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm interrupting your regularly scheduled joke for a public service announcement. As many of you know, we've been [a bit sour on generative AI](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-23-coding-agents-suck-too/)...until now. We found one that actually works: [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)! It generates working code with tests with minimal prompting. Even I was able to [fix bugs and implement features](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Atimsehn) with it. We're just Claude Code customers. We're not invested in Anthropic in any way. But our whole company is having wow moments this week. 

Plus, we think [agentic workflows like these need branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/). Dolt is [the only database that has those](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-18-database-branches/). Imagine something like Claude Code interacting with your database via an API or web interface and having the safety to make edits on branches.

### MariaDB to Dolt Replication

MariaDB implements a slightly different replication protocol than MySQL. This was confusing to me and some of our users. Could you replicate from MariaDB to Dolt or not? 

[Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) spent the time setting up MariaDB to Dolt replication and [documented how to do it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-28-mariadb-to-dolt-replication/). Thankfully, after [a small change to Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pull/9254), MariaDB databases replicate to Dolt.

### Dolt Works With Prometheus

We're on a mission to show that [Dolt just works](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps) with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, the spotlight is on [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), a popular open source metrics format. Dolt exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint if configured to do so. [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian) shows you [how to do that](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-27-prometheus-works-with-dolt/). Then, he shows you how to configure a Prometheus server to get metrics from that endpoint and graph them in [his latest blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-27-prometheus-works-with-dolt/).

### Electron on Linux

The [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench) now works on Linux. [Liu Liu](https://www.dolthub.com/team#liuliu) explains the nuances of getting an Electron app like the Dolt Workbench working on Linux in [her latest blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-05-29-building-a-linux-electron-app/).

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
