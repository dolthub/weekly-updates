This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm interrupting your regularly scheduled joke for a public service announcement. As many of you know, we've been [a bit sour on generative AI](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-23-coding-agents-suck-too/)...until now. We found one that actually works: [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)! It generates working code with tests with minimal prompting. Even I was able to [fix bugs and implement features](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Atimsehn) with it. We're just Claude Code customers. We're not invested in Anthropic in any way. But our whole company is having continuous wow moments. 

Plus, we think [agentic workflows like these need branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/). Dolt is [the only database that has those](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-18-database-branches/).
