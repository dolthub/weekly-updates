This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Thanks to everyone who reached out with positive feedback about [my Data Quality opus](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-23-data-quality-control/) from last week. It's really nice to hear when a piece you write resonates with people. If you missed it last week because of the holiday, [check it out](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-23-data-quality-control/).

I'm in our [Seattle office](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-05-dolthub-in-seattle/) this week. It's been in the 30s all week and we even had a hint of snow. I lived here for 10 years and before that I was in Canada. I'm ashamed to admit that Santa Monica has thoroughly ruined my ability to handle cold weather. Canada is going to have to revoke my citizenship.

### New Pricing Page

Our [pricing page](https://www.dolthub.com/pricing) got a remodel to better reflect our product offerings. Shout out to our designer Jan, who designed this page and every other page on [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com) and [Hosted](https://hosted.doltdb.com). Our pricing page is one of our most popular pages. It makes sense because I always click on other companies pricing pages. Let us know what you think.

### Golang os/exec patterns

[Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron) wrote a Golang oriented [blog on `os/exec` patterns](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-28-go-os-exec-patterns/) we use to test Dolt. These Golang blogs are really popular. Read it if you are a Gopher.

### Migrate To Google Analytics 4

[Taylor](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) migrated DoltHub to Google Analytics 4. It was easier than the documentation suggested so she decided to [tell the world how easy it is](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-30-adding-google-analytics-4/). The previous version of Google Analytics is being deprecated next year so you have some time. But it's nice to build up some history in the new analytics before swapping over.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
