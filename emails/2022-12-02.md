This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Thanks to everyone who reached out with positive feedback about [my Data Quality opus](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-23-data-quality-control/) from last week. It's really nice to hear when a piece you write resonates with people. If you missed it last week because of the holiday, [check it out](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-23-data-quality-control/).

I'm in our [Seattle office](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-05-dolthub-in-seattle/) this week. It's been in the 30s all week and we even had a hint of snow. I lived here for 10 years and before that I was in Canada. I'm ashamed to admit that Santa Monica has thoroughly ruined my ability to handle cold weather. Canada is going to have to revoke my citizenship.
