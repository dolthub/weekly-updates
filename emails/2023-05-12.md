This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Thanks to everyone who reached out to congratulate me on our [Dolt 1.0 release](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Remember it's not just me here, there's [a whole team of Dolts](https://www.dolthub.com/team), past and present, behind this.

### Introducing `dolt_ignore`

What if you want some tables in your Dolt database to be unversioned? These may be large tables used for logging events. These might be tables generated by triggers. Or maybe you just want to version one or two critical tables and have Dolt just work like normal MySQL for the rest of your tables.

Git has a file called [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) that allows you to specify files in a Git repository you never want to add and commit. Dolt was missing similar functionality to ignore tables until last week. 

We [introduced a new system table called `dolt_ignore`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-03-using-dolt_ignore-to-prevent-accidents/) that allows you to specify tables to never add or commit. The syntax is pretty simple.
```sql
> select * from dolt_ignore
+---------------+---------+
| pattern       | ignored |
+---------------+---------+
| generated_%  	| 1       |
+---------------+---------+
```

This will ignore all tables that begin with `generated_`. Don't ignore this feature.

### Improved Schema Merge

Dolt is the only database to support three way merge of both schema and data. Until last week, if you attempted to merge two schemas that generated [a schema conflict](https://docs.dolthub.com/concepts/dolt/git/conflicts#schema), you were out of luck. The merge would fail and Dolt would ask you to pick a side of the merge to proceed. 

Now, we have a workflow for [viewing and resolving schema conflicts](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-01-schema-conflicts/). This is very similar to the workflow for [resolving data conflicts](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/merges#data). Moreover, we vastly improved coverage and testing of schema merge cases. So, you can expect more merges to just work and if you get a merge conflict, you should be able to see why.

### Dolt 1.0

In case you missed it, [Dolt went 1.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-05-dolt-1-dot-0/) last week. Dolt is stable and ready for your production workloads. If you've been waiting to try Dolt, now is the time.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
