This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Some of you may have heard that [Adobe bought Figma for $20B](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220915005546/en/). This has a lot of silicon valley types [touting "multiplayer" experiences](https://twitter.com/levie/status/1577866100183748608). I may be a boomer but didn't that used to be called "collaboration"? Long live "multiplayer"!

### DoltHub is the Figma of Databases

Anyway, before it was cool, we've been saying [DoltHub is the Figma of databases](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-11-08-figma-of-databases/). [Taylor](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) even made what I consider [our best video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSNtbISLFrM). Dolt and DoltHub allow anyone read and write access to your database without fear of breaking anything. Read and write access combined with a GUI designed for collaboration unlocks the same creativity and efficiencies that Figma unlocked for design and developer teams. 

But Tim, aren't databases already multiplayer? Sure. But not like this.

### ER Diagrams on DoltHub

In the spirit of touting DoltHub's Figma-like qualities, we [launched Entity Relation (ER) Diagrams on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-10-05-er-diagrams-on-dolthub/) this week. DoltHub's schema support, DDL support for you database nerds, has long been pretty lacking. Sure, you can view and alter a database schema but we've been searching for ways to enhance that experience. ER Diagrams are are first crack at it.

[![ER Diagram](../images/erdiagram.png)](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-10-05-er-diagrams-on-dolthub/)

ER Diagrams, are used by database designers to perfect their database schema. Foreign key relationships between tables are represented as lines connecting foreign key columns. Usually, you would have to generate ER Diagrams using a separate tool. Now, you can render and customize an ER Diagram on DoltHub. 

See a schema optimization? Make a schema change, look at the new ER Diagram to confirm it's good, and submit a PR to your colleague to review. We're used to this workflow in software development. Bring that workflow to your database development.

### Large file uploads on DoltHub

A use case we've been driving to support is what we call "Dolt your snapshots". Right now, Dolt is best used by building a new application on it or migrating your existing MySQL instance to it. But we think an easy on ramp may be to use Dolt for better snapshots. Take a dump of your production MySQL database nightly and put that in Dolt and DoltHub via an automated job. Now you have `diff` functionality on your backups. Debugging a database problem? See when it materialized in your backups. Reinstall from the right one! We think this is an easy, additive way to add Dolt to your environment.

In service of this use case, [we launched large file uploads on DoltHUb](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-10-07-dolthub-jobs-and-doltlab-v0.6.0/). This 20Xs the size of the files we can support via DoltHub upload. But it's still not good enough. We need to [optimize our import path](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/4491). Imports are the thing we're not actively working on that I wish we were. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
