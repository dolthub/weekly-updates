This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm in Telluride, Colorado all week on a family ski trip. You're still getting the email because I'm dedicated. As I get older, my goal for ski trips is to just not end of like this:

![Zach's Knee]()

That's [Zach's knee](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach)! He broke it on the slopes a couple weeks ago. One day left for me to not share the same fate.

### DoltHub at GopherCon

[Dolt is written in Golang](https://www.doltdb.com). Golang has been a great choice for us. It is a modern, feature rich language. The feature we like most is that it compiles down to a single binary. This means that Dolt is really easy to install. You just [download the `dolt`](https://docs.dolthub.com/introduction/installation) for your operating system and start hacking.

Anyway, Zach was invited to speak at GohperCon, the annual Golang conference. He talked about performance tuning. [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiPT6g2F1Kk&t=4s) is finally posted so he took the opportunity [to highlight some other talks](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-09-dolthub-goes-gophercon/) he enjoyed.

### More Medical Procedure Prices

Hospital price data may be becoming [Dolt's Linux](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-20-search-for-dolt-linux/). We are currently running [a data bounty](https://www.dolthub.com/bounties) on behalf of [Quest Diagnostics](https://www.questdiagnostics.com/) to [pull out some lab prices](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/quest) they are interested in [from the massive insurance company data dump](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-02-a-trillion-prices/).

There's nothing like working with data to understand it's shape. [Alec](https://www.dolthub.com/team#alec) just published [some new findings about this data dump](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-11-mrf-data-deduplication/) showing how to reduce it's size with deduplication. [Read his blogs starting at "A trillion prices"](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=alec) for the past couple months if you want to see what it's like to tackle a real world data science problem.

We will continue to work on this data because it matches DoltHub's mission to support open data that has a public good. The databases we've built on DoltHub really show how [a decentralized database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-05-27-decentralized-database/) can support an open data ecosystem.
