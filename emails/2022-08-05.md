### Dolt Use Cases

Yearly, we publish a [use cases blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-07-11-dolt-case-studies/). 

[In 2020, the blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-30-dolt-use-cases/) was aspirational, we didn't really have many real users. We just launched in September 2019. [In 2021](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-03-09-dolt-use-cases-in-the-wild/), we were starting to see some real users and were refining the messaging around use cases. [This year](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-07-11-dolt-case-studies/), we have a ton of cool stories to tell. If you have a use case, please let us know. You can reply to this email. We'll be sure to include your use case in next year's blog!

### Database Versioning Survey

I published a new survey of [the database versioning space](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-04-database-versioning/). It includes this gem about distributed version control features.
