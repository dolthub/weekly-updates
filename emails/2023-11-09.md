This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Many of you might not know that you can ask [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?form=MY0291&OCID=MY0291&q=Bing+AI&showconv=1) to draw you stuff. Yes, you could do this before but this is free and accessible to most people now. So, Zach used it to generate pictures for his [virtual columns blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-03-virtual-columns/). I asked it to draw Zach with this prompt:

> draw me a picture of a red bearded man with a mullet in deep awe of what is happening on his computer screen

The likeness is uncanny. Also, notice the mouse dual-wield.
