This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Many of you might not know that you can ask [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?form=MY0291&OCID=MY0291&q=Bing+AI&showconv=1) to draw you stuff. Yes, you could do this before with other services but this is free and accessible to most people now. So, [Zach](https://www.doltub.com/team#zach) used it to generate pictures for his [virtual columns blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-03-virtual-columns/). When he shared the pictures, I asked it to draw Zach with this prompt:

> draw me a picture of a red bearded man with a mullet in deep awe of what is happening on his computer screen

The likeness is uncanny. Also, notice the mouse dual-wield.

### DoltLab Enterprise

Since its launch in early 2022, [DoltLab](https://docs.dolthub.com/products/doltlab), our on-prem version of DoltHub, has slowly been making its way into companies around the world. These companies have asked for features like look-and-feel customization and single sign on. We [launched DoltLab Enterprise](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-30-announcing-doltlab-enterprise/) to satisfy those requests. It costs $5,000/month for unlimited users and you also get our great enterprise support bundled in.

[DoltLab](https://docs.dolthub.com/products/doltlab) is still free, easy-to-install, and useful in an enterprise context. Try it today for your company.

### AUTO_INCREMENT vs UUID

We recommend you use Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) as automatically generated primary keys in Dolt. [This blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-27-uuid-keys/) explains why. You can achieve this with this SQL syntax:

```sql
create table t (id varchar(36) default(uuid()) primary key, ...);
```

TLDR: UUID keys are resistant to conflicts across branches and clones while AUTO_INCREMENT keys are only resistant to conflicts across branches. We know many ORMs use AUTO_INCREMENT keys so we share the AUTO_INCREMENT counter across branches. It's the best we can do.

### Virtual Column Support

We closed one of the last major feature gaps with MySQL by launching [virtual column support](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-03-virtual-columns/). Virtual columns are especially useful in MySQL because they are the best way to "index" JSON columns. [Zach](https://www.doltub.com/team#zach) explains how in his [blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-03-virtual-columns/).

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
