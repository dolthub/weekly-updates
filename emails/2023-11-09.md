This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Many of you might not know that you can ask [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/search?form=MY0291&OCID=MY0291&q=Bing+AI&showconv=1) to draw you stuff. Yes, you could do this before with other services but this is free and accessible to most people now. So, Zach used it to generate pictures for his [virtual columns blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-11-03-virtual-columns/). When he shared the pictures, I asked it to draw Zach with this prompt:

> draw me a picture of a red bearded man with a mullet in deep awe of what is happening on his computer screen

The likeness is uncanny. Also, notice the mouse dual-wield.

### DoltLab Enterprise

Since it's launch in early 2022, [DoltLab](https://docs.dolthub.com/products/doltlab), our on-prem version of DoltHub, has slowly been making it's way into companies around the world. These companies have asked for features like look-and-feel customization and single sign on. We [launched DoltLab Enterprise](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-30-announcing-doltlab-enterprise/) to satisfy those requests. It costs $5,000/month for unlimited users and you also get our great enterprise support bundled in.

[DoltLab](https://docs.dolthub.com/products/doltlab) is still free, easy-to-install, and useful in an enterprise context. Try it today for you company.
