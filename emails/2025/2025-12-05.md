This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm back from Thanksgiving break. We have an exciting update this week with three big feature announcements. No time for silly jokes.

### Dolt is now as Fast as MySQL

We finally did it! We matched [MySQL on sysbench](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-04-dolt-is-as-fast-as-mysql/). Sysbench is an industry standard query performance benchmark of common, simple SQL queries. 

When we first ran these benchmarks six years ago, Dolt was 15X slower than MySQL. Over the years, we steadily improved performance. Dolt 1.0, released May 2023, was about 2X slower than MySQL. We were about 10% slower than MySQL this time last year. A performance push over the last three months shaved off the last 10%. We still have work to do on [TPC-C](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/latency) (~2X slower) but for simple common queries Dolt should be as fast as MySQL on average.

Query performance was the last milestone to hit for [Dolt 2.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-29-dolt-2-0-preview/). So, let us polish some things up and get ready for an announcement in early 2026.

### JSON Diff

Dolt is the best SQL database for JSON. We [encode JSON documents in a Prolly Tree](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-15-json-prolly-trees/) which allows [structural sharing and fast retrieval](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-09-json-mysql-vs-dolt/). It also allows us to [diff and merge JSON objects fast](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-15-fast-json-merge/).

The last piece of the puzzle was to [expose JSON diffs to users](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-24-announcing-dolt-json-diff). This required some interface design. The JSON path-based visualization of diffs [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) came up with is elegant and straightforward. Combined with [lateral joins](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-10-07-lateral-joins/), getting JSON diffs from Dolt's diff [system tables](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-system-tables#database-diffs) and [functions](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-functions#table-functions) is easy and intuitive. [Nick's launch article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-24-announcing-dolt-json-diff) has a number of practical examples to crib from. 

### DoltLab on Kubernetes

Finally, DoltLab customers have been pining for Kubernetes support for a long time now. You can [now use the installer to generate Kubernetes manifests to deploy DoltLab Enterprise](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-02-announcing-doltlab-on-kubernetes). If you've been waiting for Kubernetes to try DoltLab, just reply to this email and I'll hook you up with a free trial of DoltLab Enterprise.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
