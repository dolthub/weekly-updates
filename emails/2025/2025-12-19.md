This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This will be my last email for three weeks. I know you'll miss hearing about version-controlled databases but won't miss my terrible jokes. If you miss me too much, you can just read [my Dolt year in review](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-17-dolt-wrapped-25/) over and over. Happy holidays to you and yours.

### App Builders Deserve Better Databases

App Builders, we've tried them all: [Vercel v0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-01-vercel-v0-works-with-dolt/), [Replit](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-15-replit-works-with-dolt), [Lovable](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-28-lovable-works-with-dolt), and [Bolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-04-bolt-works-with-dolt). Vercel and Replit chose Neon as their default database. [We examine why and if Dolt would be a better choice](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-15-dolt-enabled-app-builder/). App Builders, we'd love to discuss if you are interested.

### How Dolt Got as Fast as MySQL

After half a decade of work, Dolt is finally [as fast as MySQL on `sysbench`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-04-dolt-is-as-fast-as-mysql). James followed up [his announcement post](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-04-dolt-is-as-fast-as-mysql) with an [in-depth explanation of the final Golang optimizations that got us there](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-12-how-dolt-got-as-fast-as-mysql). This is a great article if you are interested in optimizing Golang performance.

### Agentic Accounting

Dolt helps you build [Cursor for Everything](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-19-cursor-for-everything/). Dolt adds [version control and testing to a capable model](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-08-agentic-ai-three-pillars/), enabling you to add an agent to any database-backed application. To show off this use case, [Dustin](https://www.dolthub.com/team#dustin) added [an agent to GnuCash](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-18-doltcash-vibe-accounting-built-on-claude-gnucash-and-dolt/), an open-source accounting tool. Read [his article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-18-doltcash-vibe-accounting-built-on-claude-gnucash-and-dolt/), for an in-depth example of how it works. Claude Code is not a very good accountant straight out of the box, but we'll keep working on it. Stay tuned.

Happy new year. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
