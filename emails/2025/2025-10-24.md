This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Like last week, I am again humorless. On Monday, I got what is called an "exercise headache", or "strain headache", and I've been gutting through it all week. But _nothing_ can stand between me and the weekly email...

### Dolt 1.75

We're pushing hard to get to [Dolt 2.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-29-dolt-2-0-preview/). Dolt 2.0 means:

1. Automated Garbage Collection on by Default
2. Archive Compression on by Default
3. Performance Parity with MySQL on `sysbench`
4. Beta Vector Support

With the release of [Dolt 1.75](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-20-dolt-1-75/), we're accomplishing (1) and (2). (3) was achieved [at the beginning of September](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-03-improving-vector-performance/). All we have left is (4): performance improvements. [James](https://www.dolthub.com/team#james) is [working on it](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/pull/9967). We're trying to get Dolt 2.0 shipped by end of year.

### Agentic Web Crawling

We've been working on [our own Dolt data import agent](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-09-data-import-agent/). We noticed coding agents weren't very good at data scraping and import tasks. We had some hypotheses we wanted to test to see if we could build a more purpose built agent. 

A couple weeks ago, we announced [d0 in private Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-09-data-import-agent/), our data import agent. This week, we wrote about [agentic web crawling](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-22-agentic-web-crawling/), an eventual sub-agent of d0, which seems essential to any data import task. These two articles are really good guides to a lot of the challenges you will face when building an agent.

### AI SQL Testing

We've been working a lot with the UC Berkeley CS department. A few weeks ago, they [published a paper about database branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-24-berkeley-cs-agents-need-branches/) that we liked. About the same time, we started to get a bunch of SQL correctness bugs from a GitHub user named `momoway`. It turns out he was part of another UC Berkeley team building [an AI powered SQL tester](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-21-ai-sql-testing/) that they pointed at Dolt. I wrote about [how it works and the bugs it found](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-21-ai-sql-testing/).

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
