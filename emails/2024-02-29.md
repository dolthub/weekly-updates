This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm back from vacation. I know you missed my humor last week so this week I'm stepping it up. I hate the joke and I'll try and think of one for next week.

### 100% `sqllogictest` Correctness

We're pleased to announce that we reached [100% correctness against the `sqllogictest` suite](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/correctness) of 5.9M queries. We started at 20% correctness, quickly got to 90% correctness, and then slowly worked our way through the 9s all the way to 100%. 

![100% Correctness]()

Of course, Dolt is far from 100% MySQL compatible. So, we're starting to report other correctness metrics like [SQL function coverage](), 60%, and [engine test success rate](), 99.4%. Engine tests are our own suite of ~43,000 hand-generated tests. When we find an edge-case query where we don't return the same results as MySQL we create a skipped engine test for it. We currently have 248 skipped tests.

Remember, we can usually fix compatibility bugs in under 24 hours, so if you find one, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues). We take pride in this 24 hour turnaround time.

### ASP.NET Core Works with Dolt

We're on a mission to show that Dolt just works with all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages. This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-02-28-works-with-dolt-dotnet-webapp/) is on [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), one of the core frameworks in Microsoft's ecosystem. 

The blog comes with [sample code](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-dotnet-webapp-sample) you can run on your own machine. You can play with a movie catalog building application complete with branches, diff, and merges.

### Shallow Clone Support

Databases are big and even bigger if you include all the history. What is you only want the latest? In Git, there is a concept called [shallow clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---depthltdepthgt) and there was a [long standing feature request for Dolt to support it](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/3403). 

Well, you can now [shallow clone in Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-02-21-shallow-clone/). It still is often better to just clone the entire Dolt database if you can spare the disk space. As they say, [results may vary](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-02-21-shallow-clone/#results).

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
