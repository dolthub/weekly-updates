This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub.

I can't believe [I signed up to write a joke per week](https://mailchi.mp/dolthub.com/tims-weekly-dolthub-update-n5f023c6xj-9162255). I'm not funny. Being funny weekly is the hardest part of this email. 

### Dolt Performance

Dolt is getting faster all the time. [Andy](https://www.dolthub.com/team#andy) has been busy building the [new, faster, storage format](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-05-20-new-format-alpha/) all year. [Max](https://www.dolthub.com/team#max) has been grinding away [making improvements to our SQL analyzer](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-14-index-join-perf/). 

[Index Join performance](../images/index-join-perf.png)

In the new format we're now pretty securely [3X MySQL on `sysbench`](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/latency) and even [9X on TPC-C](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-16-tpcc-update/), a particularly antagonistic benchmark for us. We've started including latency benchmarks in [release notes](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/tag/v0.41.4). 

Get on the new format using [`dolt migrate`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-12-new-format-migraiton/).

### Housing Price Bounty

We're in the midst of the second [US Housing Prices](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/us-housing-prices-v2) bounty. This bounty pays out weekly so get your contributions in. We've had over 250M cells added to the database since we started mid-August. 

We apologize for the rough patch in early September. This is the first bounty run in the new format and, believe it or not, rendering [the scoreboard](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/us-housing-prices-v2/bounties/6db60872-0d9a-42fb-a000-445fcbdc7c9f/scoreboard?refName=main) is one of the more technically complex things we need to do. We had some troubles migrating the scoreboard to the new format but we think we're all clear now.

Also, [the data](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/us-housing-prices-v2) is licensed Creative Commons. Get your analysis started! We're always happy to have guest data analysis posts on [our blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/) if you're trying to build a portfolio.

### go-mysql-server

[go-mysql-server](https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server) is the other open source project we support. It's fairly popular in its own right with almost 1,000 GitHub stars. `go-mysql-server` is a storage agnostic, MySQL compatible SQL engine. [Zach wrote about go-mysql-server's interface](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-12-golang-interface-extension/) this week.

We `go-mysql-server` to power Dolt so it's very full-featured, supporting indexes, foreign keys, constraints, among other SQL features. Most people use it to write MySQL integration tests that don't require a running MySQL. We don't intend to monetize `go-mysql-server` so if you're a user, throw us a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/dolthub) or at least a GitHub star.

Until next week.
