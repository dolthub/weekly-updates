This is Tim Sehn (tim@dolthub.com), Founder and CEO of DoltHub. We decided this week to ditch the automated or semi-automated emails you all were getting as users. We're a tiny company. We want to build a personal connection with as many of you as possible. Automated emails weren't helping with that. I'm going to write this weekly email to you all every Friday until I can't, which I hope is many years from now.

# That belongs in a museum...

We're making great progess on the [museum collections bounty](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/museum-collections). We're up to 10.6M pieces of art, sculptures, and historical artifacts in `main`.

```bash
museum-collections $ dolt sql -q "select count(*) from objects"
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
| 10659271 |
+----------+
```

We have approximately [20 outstanding Pull Requests](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/museum-collections/pulls) to review and merge. The top bounty hunter is [in line to make ~$3,400](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/museum-collections/bounties/880c0d21-c334-4417-bc18-8be7bddfb062/scoreboard). We continue to be inspired by the bounty process' ability to generate awesome open data to drive [interesting, socially relevant analysis](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-07-01-hospitals-compliance/).

# Released this week

We released [0.40.18](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/tag/v0.40.18) and [0.40.19](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/tag/v0.40.19) this week. These two releases contain our usual cadence of bug fixes, small features, and usability improvements.

The major user-facing change is to how we handle [privileges configuration](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/server/access-management). 

Before, to enable users and grants, you had to specify a privileges file. But in the Dolt 0.40.18, a `privileges.db` file is created for you automatically when you need it. To keep compatibility with MySQL, we use an un-versioned `mysql` database for privileges.

# New Format Progress

[All bats tests now pass](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-07-20-chasing-bats/) in the [new, faster Dolt storage format](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-05-20-new-format-alpha/). We are working on a migration path and getting DoltHub to work with it. But, it's ready to try for new databases if you don't use DoltHub. 

You can create a new format database by running:

```
new-format $ DOLT_DEFAULT_BIN_FORMAT=__DOLT_1__ dolt init
Successfully initialized dolt data repository.
```

You can tell a database is in the new format by looking at the `manifest`:

```
new-format $ cat .dolt/noms/manifest 
5:__DOLT_1__:s4ehn72v6a6dpku4e6f67255q8m2qbps:4msi0e7b1rbvefjkd866q1d4dudlklvg:00000000000000000000000000000000:5dlu9rq6h4ojbl2s4kelg9dm9951pj2b:3:k1r7p5rihlpb93r17nanqkdfurqhoiv8:2:bv7v6se90jltqq1vs6lichq4lqj1lv74:4
```

The main benefit is performance. The new format is about 2X faster for common queries and 5-10X faster for [Dolt system table](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-system-tables) queries.
