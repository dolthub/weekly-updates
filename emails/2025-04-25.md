This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

We're in Santa Clara next week at the [Generative AI Summit](https://world.aiacceleratorinstitute.com/location/siliconvalley). Stop by our booth if you want to put a face to my hilarious jokes.

### Doltgres Just Works

In case you missed it, last week, we launched [Doltgres in Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-16-doltgres-goes-beta/)! Doltgres is the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt, version controlled Postgres.

The Doltgres team has been in the lab cooking so we haven't been talking about Doltgres much. Well, the team is out of work jail and now has time to tell you all about Doltgres. 

[Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) wrote about [improvements to Doltgres import compatibility](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-22-more-pgdumps-progress/), the key to getting started with Doltgres if you have an existing Postgres database. [Taylor](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) wrote about using [Doltgres with Knex](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-21-doltgres-and-knexjs/), a popular Javascript database connection framework. I wrote about using [Doltgres with Django](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-24-doltgres-django/).

If you have a tool you need Doltgres to work with, please let us know.

### Heap Allocations in Golang

The latest in [our Golang Blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is about [heap allocations](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-18-optimizing-heap-allocations/). [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) faced a pretty nasty performance regression that could be fixed with a one line change. Be aware of the performance implications of [heap versus stack allocation](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-18-optimizing-heap-allocations/).

### Falling out of Love with AI

[Dustin](https://www.dolthub.com/team#dustin) was so excited to work on generative AI projects in January that he messaged me while I was on vacation. He couldn't wait until I was back to get started working with the latest LLMs. 

Fast forward three months and he is pretty disillusioned. [AI couldn't write blogs](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-25-announcing-robot-blogger/). [AI SQL recommendations](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-25-announcing-an-llm-powered-sql-assistant-on-dolthub/) are bad and [cost $5,000/month in infrastructure](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-09-weve-been-conned-the-truth-about-llms/). Even [AI Coding agents can't do simple tasks](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-23-coding-agents-suck-too/).

Are we doing it wrong? Or is AI more hype than substance for companies like ours? If you're getting value out of AI, please reply to this email and let us know how!

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
