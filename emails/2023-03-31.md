This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Another [@spacelove blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-23-illusion-of-transparency/), another hit. Time to break out the meme!

### Introducing `dolt_patch()`

[We released `dolt_patch()` this week](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-24-introducing-dolt-patch/). [`dolt_patch()`](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-functions#dolt_patch) is a table function that produces the SQL statements based on the `diff` between two commits. You could previously do this from the CLI with `dolt diff -r sql`. `dolt_patch()` puts that functionality in the SQL context.

```
$ dolt sql -q "SELECT statement FROM DOLT_PATCH('main','dev','products') WHERE diff_type = 'data';"
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| statement                                                                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| INSERT INTO `products` (`id`,`name`,`version`) VALUES (1,'Dolt','0.75.6'); |
| INSERT INTO `products` (`id`,`name`,`version`) VALUES (2,'DoltHub',NULL);  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

`dolt_patch()` is of particular use with the new [Versioned MySQL replica](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/) Dolt mode. Use `dolt_patch()` to patch a production MySQL from your Versioned Dolt Replica as described in the [Getting Started blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/#revert-a-bad-change).

### Debugging Slow SQL Queries

We're finally at the stage where we are tackling correctness and performance of our SQL Analyzer. This is a notoriously hard problem. This week we published two blogs on the topic, the first about [how to debug SQL query performance as a Dolt user](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-23-debugging-perf/) and the second on [how to modify Dolt as a contributor if you find an analyzer bug](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-27-debugging-dolt/). 

This is a call to all you aspiring database nerds on this list. Come [fix bugs in our SQL analyzer](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aanalyzer)! These bugs will test your CS skills, leet code style. 

### Swiss Map

This week we [announced the release](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-28-swiss-map/) of our [open source Golang implementation of Swiss Map](https://github.com/dolthub/swiss). Swiss Map is a memory efficient hash table used for large tables. Check out the memory footprint difference!

We will continue to be great contributors to the Golang community. Stay tuned.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
