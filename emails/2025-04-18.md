This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm sure you all noticed that I did not send an email last week. I was on vacation in my motherland. This week I'm back to hilarious jokes.

[![Doltgres Beta](../images/doltgres-beta.png)](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-16-doltgres-goes-beta/)

It's launch week for us here at DoltHub. [Doltgres is Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-16-doltgres-goes-beta/). Doltgres is ready to take your production Postgres workloads or [run as a replica](https://docs.doltgres.com/guides/replication-from-postgres) to your production Postgres. If you find a correctness issue, we will [turn around a fix in 24 hours or less](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-15-24-hour-bug-fixes/), just like Dolt.

For those of you that don't want to run a database yourself, [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com/) supports Doltgres servers. Just choose Doltgres in the "Cluster" dropdown when you create a deployment. 

We still [recommend Dolt over Doltgres](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-17-doltgres-over-dolt/) for most users but if you must have Postgres, you now have a version controlled option. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
