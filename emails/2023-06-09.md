## DoltLab 1.0

Continuing our [Dolt 1.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-05-dolt-1-dot-0/) extravaganza, we bring to you [DoltLab 1.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-06-05-announcing-doltlab-1-dot-0/), now backed by Dolt. A few weeks ago, we [announced DoltHub was backed by Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-12-dolthub-on-hosted-dolt/) signalling Dolt was ready to back our production OLTP application so it's ready to back yours. Now, if you're running DoltLab 1.0, you're running an OLTP Dolt as well.
