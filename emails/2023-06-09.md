This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

We have a new [DoltHub homepage](https://www.dolthub.com/) which emphasizes the easiest way we've found to describe Dolt, "It's like Git and MySQL had a baby". Some people take this too literally and let their imagination run wil with it, with [humorous consequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb2AvF8XzII&t=128s).

## DoltLab 1.0

Continuing our [Dolt 1.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-05-dolt-1-dot-0/) extravaganza, we bring to you [DoltLab 1.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-06-05-announcing-doltlab-1-dot-0/), now backed by Dolt. A few weeks ago, we [announced DoltHub was backed by Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-12-dolthub-on-hosted-dolt/) signalling Dolt was ready to back our production OLTP application so it's ready to back yours. Now, if you're running DoltLab 1.0, you're running an OLTP Dolt as well.

### Collation Support in Regex

A couple weeks ago we announced regex collation support. Unexpectedly, getting there [involved using WASM](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-19-wasm-in-go/). This also made us deep dive into MySQL's collation regex support and we discovered some [interesting edge cases](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-06-02-replicating-unexpected-behavior/). If you want togeek out on esoteric MySQL behavior, this is the blog for you.

I'm telling you about this because this blog signals how seriously we take MySQL compatibility. We want Dolt to be a drop in replacement for MySQL and this means mimicking MySQL's strengths along with its warts. If we're worried about Regex compatibility off in teh far corners of non-utf8 collations, imagine what [we've already accomplished compatibility-wise](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/correctness).

### Improved JSON Support

Dolt continues to get better at JSON. Initially, we were [skeptical JSON + Dolt was a good fit](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-06-30-working-with-json/). Dolt provides cell-wise diffs for tabular data but could not so the same for JSON data. But people just kept showing up with JSON columns in their SQL tables so we decided to embrace JSON rather than fight it. We started with [better JSON diffs on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-21-introducing-improved-json-and-text-diffs-on-dolthub/) and then [better JSON Command line diffs](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-18-unlocking-time-travel/). Now, we've [massively improved JSON function support](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-06-07-better-json-support/). Bring Dolt your JSON.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
