This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

To help me in my joke plight, a reader suggested a joke last week. Presented without edits.

> What did Baby Corn say to Mom Corn? Where is Popcorn!

I think it's better, certainly more corny, than the AI-generated jokes.

### Dolt can merge JSON

Dolt is the only SQL database with branch and merge. Until recently, data merge conflicts were detected at the "cell-level". If two branches modified the same row, column pair, a conflict was detected and the merge required manual resolution. [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) recently [changed this behavior for JSON-typed columns](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-16-announcing-json-merge/). 

Now, Dolt makes an attempt to merge the two JSON objects. If the two branches modify different JSON keys, Dolt successfully merges the two JSON objects. [Nick's blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-16-announcing-json-merge/) goes into detail about how this works. This is an active area of development for us so expect more JSON merge and storage features in the coming months.

### Bug fixes in 24 hours or less

If you've been waiting to try Dolt until it's stable, I'm here to assure you it's stable. It's so stable in fact that we take pride in fixing MySQL compatibility bugs in 24 hours or less. If you find something Dolt does differently than MySQL, submit [an issue](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues), and we'll have a new Dolt version with the fix in less than 24 hours. We love fixing bugs for customers.

### Golang 1.22

[Jason](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) wrote the latest in [our Golang blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang). This time he [previews Golang 1.22](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-01-12-golang-1-22rc/). Jason dives into new language features with simple examples to ease you into the new Golang version.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
