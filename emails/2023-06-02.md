### Hosted Dolt Replicas

This week we launched [Hosted Dolt replicas](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-31-hosted-dolt-replication/). You can now start a Hosted Dolt deployment with up to eight read only replicas. That is not a technical limit, let us know of you need more. Hosted Dolt will keep getting better and we think it's the best way to run Dolt for production use cases.

Next up we are adding scaling up and down replicas on an existing deployment and manual failover to a replica.

### Dolt Events

I didn't even know MySQL had this feature until [a potential customer showed up with a dump file with an Event in it](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/5498). In MySQL you can set up scheduled jobs called [Events](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-event.html). We [now support creating events](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-30-introducing-dolt-events/) and support for running them is coming soon. 

Events can be used with Dolt's version control features to make nightly Dolt commits, perform weekly garbage collection, or merge main into feature branches on a schedule.

### Golang Testing



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
