This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

[Dolt has been 1.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-05-dolt-1-dot-0/) for about a month now and we're starting to see the returns. Thanks to all of you who are adopting Dolt now that we said it is ready. If you've been waiting to try Dolt, now is the time.

### Hosted Dolt Replicas

This week we launched [Hosted Dolt replicas](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-31-hosted-dolt-replication/). You can now start a Hosted Dolt deployment with up to eight read only replicas. That is not a technical limit, let us know of you need more. Hosted Dolt will keep getting better and we think it's the best way to run Dolt for production use cases.

Next up we are adding scaling up and down replicas on an existing deployment and manual failover to a replica.

### Dolt Events

I didn't even know MySQL had this feature until [a potential customer showed up with a dump file with an Event in it](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/5498). In MySQL, you can set up scheduled jobs called [Events](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-event.html). We [now support creating events](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-30-introducing-dolt-events/) and support for running them is coming soon. 

Events can be used with Dolt's version control features to make nightly Dolt commits, perform weekly garbage collection, or merge main into feature branches on a schedule. Moreover, your event definitions can get human review before you put them live in production using DoltHub's, DoltLab's, or  the Hosted Dolt Workbench's Pull Request workflow.

### Golang Testing

We publish a [Golang focused blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) that has become quite popular. Our latest installment is about [testing code that needs multiple Golang processes](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-25-debugging-multiple-golang-processes/). This isn't quite as cool as [C to WASM to Go](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-19-wasm-in-go/) or [Swiss Map](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-28-swiss-map/) but may be a bit more commonly useful.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
