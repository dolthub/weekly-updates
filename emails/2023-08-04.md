This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Many people have responded to my complaints about joke writing with the suggestion to use GPT to write my jokes. This is a bad idea. Jokes are funny. Jokes are important. Jokes are dangerous. Jokes are art. I refuse to cede this responsibility to the machines. GPT jokes are terrible.

### RugGeD Stack



### Dolt Analyzer Performance



### Golang Yacc Parser Tips and Tricks



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
