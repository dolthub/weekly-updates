This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

The joke is on me this week. There are not 6.7M pages in Wikipedia. There are 6.7M articles, 23.5M pages. [This import](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/timsehn/media_wiki) is going to take [a lot longer](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-09-wikipedia-update/).

### DoltHub CI on Pull Requests 

As promised when [we launched an initial version of DoltHub Continuous Integration](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-14-continuous-integration-on-data/), the improvements keep coming. You can now [run CI on Pull Request](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-12-pull-request-ci-on-dolthub/). This article has a great example of some of the ways you can leverage version control in your tests. It gives an example on how to check a table only grows using a `dolt_diff_<table>` query. 

DoltHub CI is one of the features I'm most excited about. Being able to run automated tests on a branch of data to ensure data quality is a step function improvement in many data workflows. We think Dolt plus DoltHub can be a critical piece of [data ingestion or gold table workflows](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-28-dolt-for-data-engineers/).

### MySQL 9.0

Homebrew got the latest "innovation release", MySQL 9.0, and it broke a bunch of people. The MySQL client that ships with 9.0 does not support `mysql_native_password` the default way to connect to most MySQLs running in the wild, including Dolt. The new authentication method is `caching_sha2_password`.

We did a bunch of work to support the new `caching_sha2_password` authentication method. [This article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-11-mysql9-and-caching-sha2-auth-support/) announces that release but also explains how to work around MySQL 9.0 issues. So, while we wait on Homebrew, you can use the MySQL 9.0 client if you create your users with `caching_sha2_password`. Otherwise, you have to downgrade to MySQL 8.4. Apparently, MySQL did not intend to deprecate `mysql_native_password` support in the client they ship with 9.0, so hopefully our friends at Homebrew fix this soon. 

### Doltgres System Tables

We're working hard on [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), our Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. We're shooting for a [Q1 Beta release](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-06-doltgres-beta/). Q1 is really close so Doltgres is getting quite stable. We're looking for early adopters so if you have a use case, reply to this email.

We altered [Dolt system table syntax to be more Postgres-y](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-06-doltgres-system-tables/), which means some system tables are part of a new `dolt` schema. [This article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-06-doltgres-system-tables/) explains those changes and why they are necessary.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
