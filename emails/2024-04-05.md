### Dolt Annual Update

For those of you that don't pay much attention to these weekly updates but want a high level overview on how good Dolt has become and where we're taking it next, I have [an article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-04-03-state-of-dolt/) for you! Modeled after the annual State of the Union address, I discuss [Dolt stability, correctness, performance, and features](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-04-03-state-of-dolt/) highlighting gaps and our plans to close them. Just imagine me standing behind a podium as you read it.
