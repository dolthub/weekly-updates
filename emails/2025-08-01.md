This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I have a joke interspersed into this email so I feel a lot less pressure to have a joke for the lead. See if you can find it.

### Dolt is the Database for Agents

[Agents need branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-05-cursor-database-branches/). Dolt is [the only SQL database with branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-18-database-branches/). Thus, Dolt is the database for agents. [Our homepage](https://www.dolthub.com/) now even says so, complete with [a cool new graphic](https://www.dolthub.com/images/database-for-agents.webp). 

You're going to be hearing a lot about agents in this email in the next few months. We're very excited about it.

### Rogue Agents

Speaking of which, in a very popular story, [a rogue Replit agent destroyed months of data](https://x.com/jasonlk/status/1946069562723897802) last week. The CEO of Replit had to [issue a public apology](https://abc7news.com/post/artificial-intelligence-ceo-san-francisco-tech-company-replit-apologizes-ai-chatbot-goes-rogue/17295335/). 

Dolt protects you from rogue agents with version control. [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com) wrote [an article about how to use Replit with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-30-rogue-agents/) in response. This is following on another article and sample application he built showing off [an agentic Helpdesk app backed by Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-25-agentic-helpdesk/). Dolt really is the database for agents.

### Hunting Memory Leaks

Enough about agents, let's talk about my other favorite topic, [Prolly Trees](https://docs.dolthub.com/architecture/storage-engine/prolly-tree). Just kidding. 

The latest in [our Golang series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is on [finding memory leaks in CGO](http://dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-24-hunting-a-memory-leak/). This one baffled us for a few weeks but we finally got to the bottom of it. Very informative for the Gophers out there, especially those using CGO.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
