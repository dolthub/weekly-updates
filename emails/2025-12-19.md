This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This will be my last email for three weeks. I know you'll miss hearing about version-controlled databases but won't miss my terrible jokes. If you miss me too much, you can just read [my Dolt year in review](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-17-dolt-wrapped-25/) over and over. Happy holidays to you and yours.

### App Builders Deserve Better Databases

App Builders, we've tried them all: [Vercel v0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-01-vercel-v0-works-with-dolt/), [Replit](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-15-replit-works-with-dolt), [Lovable](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-28-lovable-works-with-dolt), and [Bolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-04-bolt-works-with-dolt). Vercel and Replit chose Neon as their default database. [We examine why and if Dolt would be a better choice](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-12-15-dolt-enabled-app-builder/). App Builders, we'd love to discuss if you are interested.
