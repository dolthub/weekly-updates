It's time to break out the HackerNews meme!

Well, not quite, but Zach's irreverent [4-chan Go Programmer article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-23-the-4-chan-go-programmer/) got to #2.

### Dolt for Data Engineers

Inspired by some of my conversations at Ai4 with folks on the analytics side of the data stack, I went back to one of our greatest hits, [my data quality control article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-11-23-data-quality-control/), and [got into some specifics](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-28-dolt-for-data-engineers/) about how Dolt can be used on the analytics side of the house. I suggest Dolt can be used as a [Data Staging Area](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-28-dolt-for-data-engineers/#the-data-staging-area) or to [version Control your Gold Tables](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-28-dolt-for-data-engineers/#version-controlled-gold-tables). 

[![Data Staging Area](../images/data-staging-area.png)](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-28-dolt-for-data-engineers/)

These are cool use cases. If you're a data engineer and are Dolt curious, let's work together to implement one or both of these ideas. Just respond to this email.
