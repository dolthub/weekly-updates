### Improved Dolt CLI

One of the problems that plagued the Dolt CLI was the presence of a running SQL server. At first, we would just happily stomp on the underlying data that was being used by the CLI and running server, with sometimes disastrous results. Stupid concurrency. So, to fix that, we added a lock file so write commands from the CLI wouldn't work when a Dolt server was running. Lock files are error prone and we still got bitten by edge cases. Plus, people were like, "I just want to run `dolt commit` what do you mean the database is locked?"

The obvious solution was to make the CLI work whether there was a server running or not. This is obvious but tricky to do. Well, [we pulled it off](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-07-21-cli-to-hosted/)!. You can now use most Dolt CLI commands with a running server. This has the added benefit of making the CLI work with a server running in the cloud, like a [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com/) server. Let us know if you have a CLI command that doesn't work yet fixed.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
