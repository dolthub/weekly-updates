This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This is going to be the last joke of 2024. Remember when [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) coined the term [4-Chan Go programmer](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-23-the-4-chan-go-programmer/). That was funny. Talk to you again January 10, 2025. 

### Remotes on the Workbench

One of my favorite products of the year is the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench) desktop app. It's free and open source. It's available in the [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolt-workbench/id6720702995?mt=12) and [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nq8lqph9vvh?hl=en-us&gl=US) App stores. It works with any MySQL or Postgres-compatible databases but [really shines when used with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-02-workbench-better-with-version-control/). Once you use a workbench with Dolt, you'll realize other SQL databases are from the past. Dolt really is the future.

Well, we made the workbench even better for version controlled databases by [adding a remotes tab](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-17-announcing-the-dolt-workbench-remotes-tab/). Dolt supports clone, push, pull and fetch from remotes like [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com) or [DoltLab](https://www.doltlab.com). The new remotes user interface in the workbench makes these features more usable and discoverable.

### Merkle Trees

Merkle Trees are the backbone of many decentralized systems. Dolt uses a Merkle Tree variant we call a [Prolly Tree](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-03-prolly-trees/) as the basis of Dolt's storage engine. [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) dives into [other tools that use Merkle Trees](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-19-merkle-trees-for-file-systems/) and compares them to Dolt. 

### Mydumper Works with Dolt

We're on a mission to show that Dolt works with [all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps). This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-13-dolt-mydumper/) is on [mydumper](https://github.com/mydumper/mydumper), an open source, more feature-rich alternative to `mysqldump`. We had to fix [a few bugs](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-13-dolt-mydumper/#challenges) but Dolt now dumps schema and data just like MySQL does using mydumper.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
