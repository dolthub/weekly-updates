This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This is going to be the last joke of 2024. Rememmer when [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) coined the term [4-Chan Go programmer](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-23-the-4-chan-go-programmer/). That was funny. Talk to you again January 10, 2025. 

### Remotes on the Workbench

One of my favorite products of the year is the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench) desktop app. It's free and open source. It's available in the [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolt-workbench/id6720702995?mt=12) and [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nq8lqph9vvh?hl=en-us&gl=US) App stores. It works with and MySQL or Postgres-compatible databases but [really shines when you use it with Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-02-workbench-better-with-version-control/). Once you use a workbench with Dolt, you'll realize other SQL databases use the same interface as the 1970s. Dolt really is the future.

Well, we made the workbench even better for version controlled databases by [adding a remotes tab](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-17-announcing-the-dolt-workbench-remotes-tab/). Dolt supports clone, push, pull and fetch from remotes like [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com) or [DoltLab](https://www.doltlab.com). The new remotes user interface in teh workbench makes these features more usable and discoverable.

### Mydumper Works with Dolt

We're on a mission to show that Dolt works with [all your favorite tools in all your favorite languages](https://docs.dolthub.com/guides/dolt-tested-apps). This week, [the spotlight](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-13-dolt-mydumper/) is on [mydumper](https://github.com/mydumper/mydumper), an open source, more feature-rich alternative to `mysqldump`. We had to fix [a few bugs](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-12-13-dolt-mydumper/#challenges) but Dolt now dumps schema and data just like MySQL does using mydumper.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
