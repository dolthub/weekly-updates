This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm the wise old age of 43 today. Maybe if I was starting this company today, I would be wise enough not to name it the hub of stupid people. Probably not.

### Dolt + Superset

I published a blog post on [how to add versioning to your dashboarding](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-27-dolt-superset/) using Dolt and [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset).

Branches can power different datasets in Superset allowing easy comparison all with the auditing capabilities of Dolt backing it all up. I go through a faulty DAU and MAU metrics scenario in [the blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-01-27-dolt-superset/) that happened to me a few times in my previous job.
