This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

When people see our logo at events, they really think the product is called "Do It". They approach our booth and say "What is do it?" We politely tell them it is Dolt, like idiot. 

What dolt would name their product that? That's us.

### SQL Bot on DoltHub

RIP [Robot Blogger](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-04-robot-blogs-suck/). Long live [SQL Bot](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-25-announcing-an-llm-powered-sql-assistant-on-dolthub/)!

We're investing in AI use cases this year to get an understanding of the space. We really think there is a lot of AI hype and we're not sure reality lives up to the promise. We're not really selling AI so we think we can be honest brokers. We're particularly excited about [Dolt's potential with AI agents](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/) and the Cursor folks [agreed with us on Lex Friedman](https://lexfridman.com/cursor-team-transcript/#chapter13_branching_file_systems). If you know them, point them at Dolt for me...

Anyway, with [the new SQL recommendations on DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-25-announcing-an-llm-powered-sql-assistant-on-dolthub/), I really like the UI but the results still suck. We're running a Deepseek model on our own hardware because we don't want to leak any private information in the prompt. Stay tuned for more updates here. We're trying stuff.

### Automated Garbage Collection

[Aaron](https://www.dolhub.com/team#aaron) did a technical deep dive on [how the new automated garbage collection works](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-21-session-aware-gc-technical-details/). He spent six months on it so there's a lot to digest. Or, you can skip [the details](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-21-session-aware-gc-technical-details/) and [just turn it on](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/server/configuration#auto_gc_behavior). 

### Dolt for Beginners

The [Dolt for Beginners series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=beginners) is now nine articles deep. The latest is on [push](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-26-dolt-basics-push/). I've pivoted the examples to use [the Dolt Workbench](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-24-dolt-basics-workbench/). GUIs are better for beginners and it [now ships with a built-in Dolt server](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-06-the-dolt-workbench-now-ships-with-a-built-in-dolt-server/) so no Terminal required. Check it out if you're a beginner or send it to beginners on your team getting started with Dolt. If you have a topic you think would be good to cover just reply to this email.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
