### Three-Way Merge

Dolt is the only SQL database that offers [three-way merge](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-19-threeway-merge/) of schema and data. My [latest blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-19-threeway-merge/) is a deep dive into three-way merge of files followed by a step-by-step guide on how Dolt three-way merges your databases. For a pretty complicated process, the results are mostly intuitive. 

Curl up and give [the blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-19-threeway-merge/) a read. It's the culmination of many years of hard work making three-way merge in Dolt intuitively work at scale.

### MySQL Replication Protocol

[Jason's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#jason) first big project at DoltHub was building binlog replication from MySQL to Dolt. His latest project is building the reverse, binlog replication from a Dolt branch to MySQL. Through both these projects he's become a binlog replication expert. In his latest blog, he explains in detail [how binlog replication works in MySQL](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-17-mysql-replication/). It's a fun technical deep dive into a somewhat mysterious protocol.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
