This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 



### Hosted Dolt

[Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com/) is quickly becoming the easiest way to run Dolt. We recently released improvements to the built in workbench. Clone a Hosted, better integration with DoltHub, and replication are all coming soon.

Taylor wrote a [DoltHub vs Hosted Dolt blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-17-dolthub-vs-hosted-workbench/) that details how we think about the workbench features of both. Our [new Pricing page](https://www.dolthub.com/compare) does the best job comparing all of our products if you or a friend is wondering which Dolt is right for you.

I've had a couple people reach out to me about a free trial instance of Hosted. If you want to try it but can't afford the $50/month, just reply to this email and say so and I'll set your account on "Do Not Collect".

Note the commit hash. Maybe I'm a `d01t` but I couldn't be more happy about this silly feature.

### Hospital Transparency Update



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
