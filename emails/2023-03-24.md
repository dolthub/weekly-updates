This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

With [HBO's Succession](https://www.hbo.com/succession) entering it's final season, a running joke in our office is that my son will be the next CEO of DoltHub. Once he came in and I asked him what he would do if [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) was watching YouTube all day at work. He said, "Fired". All I needed to hear.

### Hosted Dolt

[Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com/) is quickly becoming the easiest way to run Dolt. We recently released improvements to the built in workbench. Clone a Hosted, better integration with DoltHub, and replication are all coming soon.

Taylor wrote a [DoltHub vs Hosted Dolt blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-17-dolthub-vs-hosted-workbench/) that details how we think about the workbench features of both. Our [new Pricing page](https://www.dolthub.com/compare) does the best job comparing all of our products if you or a friend is wondering which Dolt is right for you.

I've had a couple people reach out to me about a free trial instance of Hosted. If you want to try it but can't afford the $50/month, just reply to this email and say so and I'll set your account on "Do Not Collect".

Note the commit hash. Maybe I'm a `d01t` but I couldn't be more happy about this silly feature.

### Hospital Price Transparency is Broken

As many of you know, we've been working on Hospital Price Transparency through our [data bounty program](https://www.dolthub.com/bounties) for years now. We started with [Hospital Chargemasters](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency-v3). When the insurance companies were required to publish data in JSON form we were first to [sound the alarm about this massive data dump](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-09-02-a-trillion-prices/). We built [an open source tool](https://github.com/dolthub/data-analysis/tree/main/transparency-in-coverage/python/mrfutils) to sift through this massive JSON trove. 

We're using that tool to see if we can match chargemasters to [this insurance data](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-prices-allpayers/doc/main) to see if any of it makes sense. We're pretty sure [it doesn't make sense](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-23-illusion-of-transparency/). How can we get accurate pricing data for medical procedures? We'll continue to fight the good fight here.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
