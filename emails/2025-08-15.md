This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 



### Dolt MCP Server

This week, we released [the first version of the Dolt MCP Server](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-14-announcing-dolt-mcp/). The promise of Dolt is that it allows your MCP Servers to be safely writable. Writes happen on database branches so bad things can't happen. Dolt's MCP server integrates version control into all its exposed tools. If you're building an MCP server for your application, consider backing it with Dolt.

By comparison, [Postgres' MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/postgres) is read-only because agents make mistakes. [MySQL's](https://github.com/designcomputer/mysql_mcp_server) is writable because YOLO...I guess. Postgres' MCP Server was build by Anthropic as part of the MCP launch. MySQL's is built by `designcomputer` a small software shop. I think I trust Anthropic's judgment on this one.

We're going to be investing heavily in Dolt's MCP functionality, even shipping it inside Dolt itself. We'd love to hear your feature requests and bug reports.

### Agentic Data Collection

We used to run [data bounties](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-09-18-bye-bye-bounties/). Paid volunteers would collect and publish data we were interested in to DoltHub. Could agents do the same thing? [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian) tries to answer that question in [his latest article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-11-agentic-data-collection/). TLDR; His first attempt failed but it reinforced the idea that databases need version control when working with agents.

### Hosting a Dolt Workbench for your Team

One of our long-standing customers asked for [a centralized Dolt Workbench for their team](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-13-hosting-a-dolt-workbench-for-your-team/). The customer has people who must edit a single cell in their Dolt database every six months or so. Downloading a new app to do that is a bit cumbersome. A central web interface is simple and easy. Setting this up with the existing Dolt Workbench is pretty easy and in [Eric's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#eric) first ever article, [he tells you how to do it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-13-hosting-a-dolt-workbench-for-your-team/).

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
