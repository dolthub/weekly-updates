This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This weekly email is old school. No talk of agents or AI whatsoever. Just features and Golang like 2024 Tim used to make.

### Foreign Keys to System Tables

We had a customer that wanted to add metadata, like the user that created the branch, to Dolt branches. The natural way to do this would be to extend the `dolt_branches` system table using a [foreign key](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-05-mysql-foreign-keys/) relationship to another table with the additional metadata. Unfortunately, we did not allow foreign key relationships to Dolt system tables. 

Well, we do now. You can [now extend the dolt_branches table using a foreign key](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-16-foreign-keys-to-system-tables-/) using the branch name. If you'd like other system table columns available for foreign key references, [just ask](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues/new) or reply to this email.

### Skinny `dolt diff`

We long had a "skinny" view for `dolt diff` in the Dolt CLI. It's so old, we don't even have a blog article about it. Skinny diff view hides the columns that did not change between diff targets. This is especially useful for wide tables. This week, per a customer request, [we implemented skinny is the `dolt_diff()` table function](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-15-focused-diffs-with-skinny-and-include-cols/) so the same functionality is available via SQL. 

I hope you are sensing a theme. We are very responsive to customer requests. 

### Go Channels

The latest in [our Golang Blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is about [Channels](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-12-go-channels-for-period-mismatch/). [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) is back from paternity leave to explain [how he used Channels for a non-obvious use case](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-12-go-channels-for-period-mismatch/). 

I thought [this article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-12-go-channels-for-period-mismatch/) was good but the internet was not so kind, accusing Zach of being a junior Golang developer. I know. Shocking. No one is ever mean on the internet.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
