This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I was in New York City this week presenting at an AI conference. I'm typing this in the Newark airport waiting to get on my flight back to Los Angeles. There really is nothing funny about this.

### Prolly Trees

Dolt's core data structure is called a [Prolly Tree](https://docs.dolthub.com/architecture/storage-engine/prolly-tree). This term was coined by the good folks at [Noms](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms) who we credit for inventing the data structure...until now. 

[Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) did a bunch of research on [every Prolly Tree adjacent implementation he could find](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-03-people-keep-inventing-prolly-trees/). It turns out there's a similar data structure in [bup](https://bup.github.io/) dated 2009. The Noms folks did name the data structure a Prolly Tree which is the name we prefer. I thought [Nick's article was a great deep dive](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-03-people-keep-inventing-prolly-trees/).

### Agents Need Branches

We think [AI agents need branches](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-03-17-dolt-agentic-workflows/) to work effectively. For AI agents to operate on databases which back most applications, databases need branches. As I mentioned in a earlier email, the Cursor folks [said the same on Lex Friedman](https://lexfridman.com/cursor-team-transcript/#chapter13_branching_file_systems). I grabbed the transcript of their conversation and [added my commentary](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-05-cursor-database-branches/). We mostly agree. Databases need branches. I just wish they knew about Dolt.

### Dolt Turns 10

On June 2, we hit the 10 year anniversary of the first [Noms](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms) commit, which is the beginning of Dolt's commit history. To celebrate the milestone, [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) walked through [Dolt's ten year timeline](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-02-dolt-turns-10/) from and engineer's perspective. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
