This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

We're big fans of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/). We've referenced their open source SQL engine work a lot in [Dolt](https://www.doltdb.com). THis week they talked about [the CAKE stack](https://thenewstack.io/have-some-cake-the-new-stateful-serverless-stack/): \

**C**ockroachDB
**A**uthorization, authentication, session and user management
**K**ubernetes
**E**vent-driven serverless platforms

Honestly, this is kind of some weak acronym play compared to the classics [JAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamstack), [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack), or the OG, [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)). But it got us thinking what would be a good Dolt stack. After some clever word play, the people who brought you Dolt give to you the DORK stack!

**D**olt
**O**RM
**R**eact
**K**ubernetes

This stack powers the [Hosted Dolt])(https://hosted.doltdb.com) website. Have a better one? Reply to this email and I'll shout it out next week.
