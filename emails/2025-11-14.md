This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

We're [expecting a few days of rain](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/South+Beach+Santa+Monica+California?canonicalCityId=4f67b87249f8dec27f6d143c96d92014) here in LA and there is a palpable sense of excitement. Will our office leak? How many people will come to work? This town is weird.

### Building an Agent: Looping

[Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian) has been hard at work for the past couple months building d0, our data engineering agent. He has been "developing out loud", publishing all of his learnings in epically long blog articles. The first was [an agentic development starters guide](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-09-19-agentic-development). He then wrote about his work [building the first version of our data import agent](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-09-data-import-agent). He followed that up talking about [a web crawling agent and the challenges building that](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-10-22-agentic-web-crawling).

This week, he talks about [how to improve an agent by doing "goal-based planning"](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-10-planning). This article is about how to add the looping until a result is correct that works so effectively for coding agents. This work really improved d0 and we're looking for early testers. If you want to test d0, just reply to this email and we'll get you early access.

### Go CPU Profiling on Mac is Broken

We have a public service announcement (PSA) for Mac users. Don't use your laptop to profile your Golang program. It's broken and gives misleading results. [Read more about it in James' article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-07-profiling-on-mac-is-broken). We discovered this because the last milestone we have to hit to ship [Dolt 2.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-29-dolt-2-0-preview/) is performance parity with MySQL on `sysbench`. Nightly builds have us sitting at 5% slower, better than the 15% slower we were at before we realized the Golang profiler was broken on Mac.

### Agent Mode in the Dolt Workbench

You can approximate agent mode in a SQL Workbench using Claude Code with the Dolt Workbench. It's very cool. [I walk through a fun example](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-11-12-agentic-dolt-workbench) where I get Claude to imagine Dolt IPOed and the data was added to [post-no-preference' stocks database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-27-dolt-post-no-preference/). We're building this for real. Stay tuned.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
