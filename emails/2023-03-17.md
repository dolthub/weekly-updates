This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This week, my co-founder [Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron) let me in on a long standing joke. We went through a brief stint a year ago, trying to do video marketing. You can see the evidence on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dolthub4295). We had a film crew come by and film some B-roll and they used some of it in the videos. When I was reviewing one of these I was confronted with this gem.

I got all mad and I was like, "You can't be playing Cookie Clicker in our videos!" He told me this week that it was staged just to mess with me. Well played, sir. Well played.

### Versioned MySQL Replica

We settled on a name for the new MySQL binlog replication mode I've ben talking about a lot: the Versioned MySQL Replica. This week we published [a Getting Started guide for this mode](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/). 

[![Versioned MySQL Replica](../images/versioned-mysql-replica.png)](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/)

In this mode, you set up Dolt as a replica of your primary MySQL database. Every write to the primary is replicated to Dolt and a new Dolt commit is created. This means you get the ability to find bad changes to your primary MySQL and create SQL patches to roll bad changes back. [The blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/) has detailed example. You can do all this without migrating your primary off of MySQL. Just add Dolt.

### Dolt 0.75

Just in case you missed last week, we turned the chunk journal on by default making [the current Dolt release](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/tag/v0.75.3) ACID compliant. Upgrade now. Beyond durability it is also faster. We are down to [1.9X MySQL on sysbench benchmarks](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/benchmarks/latency).

The next step is Dolt 1.0 which you should see in the next quarter. It's been a long slog but Dolt is stable and ready for all your production workloads. If you've been waiting, now is the time to make the switch. Deploy [a hosted Dolt instance](https://hosted.doltdb.com/) for as little as $50/month.

### Non-Dolt Content

We published a couple non-Dolt pieces of content this week. The first is [how to make Gatsby builds in GitHub Actions incremental](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-10-caching-gatsby-builds-with-docker-in-github-actions/). The second is [Golang concurrency practical examples](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-13-golang-concurrency-examples/). We don't need to be writing about the coolest database on earth all the time, just most of the time.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
