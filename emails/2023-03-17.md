This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

This week, my cofounder [Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron) let me in on a long standing joke. We went through a brief stint a year ago, trying to do video marketing. You can see the evidence on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dolthub4295). We had a film crew come by and film some B-roll and they used some of it in the videos. When I was reviewing one of these I was confronted with this gem.

I got all mad and I was like, "You can't be playing Cookie Clicker in our videos!" He told me this week that it was staged just to mess with me. Well played, sir. Well played.

### Versioned MySQL Replica

We settled on a name for our new MySQL binlog replication mode: the Versioned MySQL Replica. This week we published [a Getting Started guide for this mode](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/). In this mode, you set up Dolt as a replica of your primary MySQL database. Every write to the primary is replicated to Dolt and a new Dolt commit is created. This means you get the ability to find bad changes to your primary MySQL and create SQL patches to roll bad changes back. [The blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/) has detailed example.
