This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I got to make [a whole blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-22-just-dolt/) full of fake "Just Dolt" advertisements.  Some people think "Dolt" is "DoIt", "Do It" with the space removed. So, I riffed on "Just Do It." There is a point though. I'm trying to [explain Dolt use cases better](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-22-just-dolt/).

### C to WASM to Go

We started supporting [collations and character sets](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-29-finally-adding-collations/) in Dolt last August. There was one big weakness in our support: regular expressions. `LIKE` was not collation aware.

MySQL implements regexes using [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org/design/regular-expressions/utext-for-regex) which is a C library. We faced a choice. We could try and make ICU work in Golang or we could write our own ICU regex emulator. [Daylon](https://www.dolthub.com/team#daylon) talks about [his journey](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-29-finally-adding-collations/) figuring out a way to include ICU in Dolt while keeping Dolt a single compiled binary. 

In a shocking twist, [the answer is WASM](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-29-finally-adding-collations/)!

### Hospital Price Bounty Update

Hospital Price Transparency is our open data mission. We're taking our fourth pass at Hospital charge masters and it's our best yet. [Spacelove](https://www.dolthub.com/team#alec) wrote about [the database and some data exploration he did](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-05-24-400-hospitals/).
