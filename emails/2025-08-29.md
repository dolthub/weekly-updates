This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub.

### Never Trust an Agent

We're fond of saying "Agents need branches". But, we think [agents also need clones](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-25-agents-need-clones/). Dolt is the only SQL database that supports multiple, decentralized clones. Having a completely separate host for an agent to play with is the ultimate protection against rogue agents. Sometimes branches aren't enough.

### Running Multiple Coding Agents in Parallel

[Elian's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#elian) first blog article is about how he uses [four coding agents in parallel]() to get more done. I'm pretty sure it's true because I can attest to his $2,000 Claude Code bill last month. Anyway, this article shows you how to use multiple containers to run isolated coding agents. It's a pretty cool set up if you ask me.

### The Docker Trilogy

In my opinion, the Docker Trilogy is definitely better than at least one of the Star Wars trilogies. [Dustin](https://www.dolthub.com/team#dustin) is our Docker George Lucas. The Docker trilogy begins by explaining [Docker itself](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-07-22-a-beginners-guide-to-docker/), the hero origin story. The second episode tackles an identity crisis where [Docker Compose](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-19-a-beginners-guide-to-docker-compose/) has the hero dealing with multiple versions of itself. Finally, in the final installment, [Docker Swarm](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-08-27-a-beginners-guide-to-docker-swarm/) has multiple Docker containers on different hosts unite to tackle the ultimate enemy, scaling your service. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
