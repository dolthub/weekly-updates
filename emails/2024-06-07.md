### Dolt Commands in SQL Shell

Dolt ships with a built-in SQL shell. Type `dolt sql` and Dolt connects to a local copy of your Dolt database. In this shell, you can run any SQL you wish to inspect or modify the data in your database. Until recently, if you wanted to view the Dolt log or make a Dolt commit, you were restricted to Dolt system tables, functions or, procedures exposed via SQL. For instance, `select * from dolt_log limit 3`.

No longer. [Neil](https//www.dolthub.com/team#neil) spent the weekend adding the Dolt CLI to the SQL shell. Now, you can run the Dolt command line commands from within the shell by typing `\log` or `\diff`. The marriage of MySQL and Git in Dolt was always the goal and this new user interface is pretty handy.
