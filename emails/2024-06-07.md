This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Apparently, thanks to another reader, the joke I told last week as classic and has a [whole page on the internet dedicated to it](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html). This just proves that Computer Scientists aren't funny. Why oh why did I commit to a joke per week?

### Dolt Commands in SQL Shell

Dolt ships with a built-in SQL shell. Type `dolt sql` and Dolt connects to a local copy of your Dolt database. In this shell, you can run any SQL you wish to inspect or modify the data in your database. Until recently, if you wanted to view the Dolt log or make a Dolt commit, you were restricted to Dolt system tables, functions or, procedures exposed via SQL. For instance, `select * from dolt_log limit 3`.

No longer. [Neil](https//www.dolthub.com/team#neil) spent the weekend adding the Dolt CLI to the SQL shell. Now, you can run the Dolt command line commands from within the shell by typing `\log` or `\diff`. The marriage of MySQL and Git in Dolt was always the goal and this new user interface is pretty handy.

### Sequences in Doltgres

We continue to make steady progress on [Doltgres](https://www.doltgres.com), the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. This week, [Daylon](https//www.dolthub.com/team#daylon) announced the launch of sequences, the Postgres version of `AUTO_INCREMENT`. As anyone who has used an ORM like SQLAlchemy knows, auto-generated keys are a must. This release unlocks a ton of new potential use cases. If you were waiting for Doltgres to support sequences, stop waiting. Try it today. 

### Which Dolt is Right for You?

Here at DoltHub, we build a surprisingly large number of products all built around the ["version controlled database"](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-08-04-database-versioning/) theme. We have [Dolt](https://www.doltdb.com), [Doltgres](https://www.doltgres.com), [Hosted Dolt](https://hosted.doltdb.com), [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com), [DoltLab](https://www.doltlab.com), and the [Dolt Workbench](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt-workbench).

We know this is a dazzling array of great products but people are often confused by the plethora of options. Which Dolt is right for you? My [latest blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-03-which-dolt/) tries to answer this question.
