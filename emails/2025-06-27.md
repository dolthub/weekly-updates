This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

For those paying attention, I apologize for no email last week with no advanced warning. June 19th is a holiday for us and I extended that to a 4 day weekend. I won't let it happen again, except next week when it's the July 4th holiday for us. This time at least you get some warning.

### Versioned Vector Indexes

In January, we [launched Vector Index support](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-16-announcing-vector-indexes/) in Dolt. We followed up with some [Getting Started advice](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-06-getting-started-dolt-vectors/) and then kind of let the feature sit. 

Vector Index support in Dolt is still Alpha and we're looking for a customer to work with us to improve it. Think of the possibilities if your vector indexes are version controlled. RAG worked better yesterday? Just roll back and start the debugging process. Test a new model on a branch while keeping the old embeddings live. Cool stuff.

In hopes of shaking free some interest, [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) published [an epic article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-23-vector-index-deep-dive/) on how we achieved version controlled vector indexes. If you're into data structures and algorithms, [this article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-23-vector-index-deep-dive/) is for you. The explanations and pictures really put the computer science we do here at DoltHub on full display and explain why Dolt's Vector support is different and special. 

### Merge Conflict Preview

A long standing feature request was previewing merge conflicts without actually performing a merge. "Will it merge?" so to speak.

The wait is over. [Taylor](https://www.dolthub.com/team#taylor) announced support for two new Dolt procedures and workbench support for [previewing merge conflicts](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-25-preview-merge-conflicts/). Next step is to bring the UI to DoltHub and DoltLab. Then, we'll build conflict resolution through all our graphical user interfaces. 

### Prolly Tree Balancing

In [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick)'s recent blog post about how [people keep inventing Prolly Trees](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-03-people-keep-inventing-prolly-trees/), he casually mentioned how Prolly Trees are self-balancing. As the author of the [Prolly Tree opus](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-03-03-prolly-trees/), I was immediately curious. This was an aspect of Prolly Trees I did not cover or understand deeply. What did he mean by self-balancing? So, being the boss, I made [Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team#aaron) explain it to me and the world in [his latest article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-26-prolly-tree-balance/).

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
