This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

For those paying attention, I apologize for no email last week with no advanced warning. June 19th is a holiday for us and I extended that to a 4 day weekend. I won't let it happen again except next week when it's the July 4th holiday for us. This time at least you get some warning.
