This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

It's a big week for us here at Dolt. We released automated garbage collection, a feature we've been working on for years. The jokes I lead this email with are often garbage but I'm committed to the bit, so they won't be automatically collected.

### Automatic Garbage Collection

Dolt makes disk garbage. SQL transactions that are not part of a Dolt commit eventually end up as garbage. This is not without precedent in databases. Postgres also creates disk garbage. You just don't notice because Postgres has automated garbage collection, called "auto vacuum".

Now, Dolt also has [automated garbage collection](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-28-announcing-automatic-gc-in-sql-server/)! It's been a long time coming. We're excited for you to try it.

Automatic garbage collection is not on by default. It must be enabled using [a configuration flag](https://docs.dolthub.com/sql-reference/server/configuration#auto_gc_behavior). The feature is still experimental so enable it only if you want to help us test. Once we get comfortable it works as designed, we will enable it by default. Then, like Postgres, you won't notice that Dolt makes disk garbage and we'll never speak of it again.

### Robot Blogger

We're not sure if you noticed but we published [a Saturday blog article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-22-comparing-dolt-and-git-generated/). Yet another blog article?!? Isn't five per week enough? For mere humans maybe? This article was written by a new member of [the team](https://www.dolthub.com/team), the [robot blogger](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-25-announcing-robot-blogger/).

With the release of [Dolt vector support](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-06-getting-started-dolt-vectors/), we needed a way to test and show off Dolt's version controlled vector capabilities. We built and [open sourced a retrieval augmented generation powered blog creator](https://github.com/dolthub/robot-blogger). Stay tuned for more generated blog articles and articles about the generated articles. So meta. Like most companies, we're investing heavily in AI use cases in 2025.

### Dolt Backups

Did you know Dolt has a special set of commands for [backups](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-24-backups-why/)? Aren't those just remotes? Nope. Backups also sync your working sets, the uncommitted changes on each branch `HEAD`. Read more about this obscure feature in [Neil's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#neil) recent [article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-24-backups-why/). 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
