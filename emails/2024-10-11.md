This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Today, I'm in Atlanta sitting next to [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#fitz), the person who insists on the weekly joke. I thought this was a good opportunity for him to do the joke. His response, "I'm more of a funny observations guy". Thanks for the help Brian.

### `dolt fsck`

How can you tell that your data has not been tampered with on disk? In most databases you can't and thus, security will require your data be encrypted at rest. In Dolt, each chunk has an immutable content address, so Dolt can verify the data matches its stored content address, just like Git can do with files. We still recommend your data be encrypted at rest, but Dolt provides an extra layer of protection against this form of attack. 

In Git, this functionality is exposed via the `fsck` sub-command which stands for "filesystem check". This week, we [released `dolt fsck`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-09-fsck-announce/). I ran it on my still running [Wikipedia import](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/timsehn/media_wiki) and it verified all 400 million or so chunks in four hours.

```
Chunks Scanned: 410468310
No problems found.
```

My data is still good!

### SOX

The other [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team#brian), our co-founder, was hit by the Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) bus at our previous company. In his [latest blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-07-dolt-compliance/), he discusses how Dolt would have streamlined the whole ordeal. Dolt provides an immutable audit log of every cell in your database which generally will make your auditors very happy. If you're planning on IPOing your company or improving your SOX compliance, consider Dolt for your systems requiring audit.

### Vectors

A couple weeks ago, we [announced our plan to support vectors in Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-26-plan-for-vectors/). This week, [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) follows that announcement with a technical deep dive into [how to make Vector indexes work with Prolly Trees](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-08-how-to-build-a-vector-index-with-prolly-trees/), the core data structure that powers Dolt's versioning features. We think versioning of vector searches will be a powerful, novel capability only Dolt can provide at scale.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
