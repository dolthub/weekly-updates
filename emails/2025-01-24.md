This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Some of you may have noticed our blog schedule was also destroyed by the fires in Los Angeles. We're going to be back to our five article a week schedule next week, hot off the presses, so to speak. 

### Pull Performance Improvement

Recently a customer reported that their database was taking two and a half hours to pull. After some investigation we noticed their database had over 16,000 tags. We had some slow code related to the number of tags. [We fixed it](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-22-fetching-tags-is-faster-now/). Read [Neil's](https://www.dolthub.com/team#neil) blog [article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-22-fetching-tags-is-faster-now/) for more details.

If you run into any performance issues with push or pull or any other Dolt operation, we want to hear about it. We take performance seriously. As always, you can just reply to this email if you have been too shy in the past.

### Dolt for Beginners

We've been building Dolt for over six years now. We've been writing three blog articles a week for five years and five blog articles a week for almost a year. As we've produced more content, our articles tend to get pretty deep and expert focused. I'm aiming to change that with a new series: [Dolt For Beginners](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-23-dolt-basics/). The first [article is on the Dolt basics](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-23-dolt-basics/): installation, creating a database, doing something git-ty, starting a server, and doing something SQL-y. Dolt is like Git and MySQL had a baby.

### `convT` Performance

The latest in [our Golang Blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is about [convT performance](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-17-convt-perf/). By removing some converts we were able to speed up table scans, like `select * from t`, by over 25%. That's a big deal. [The article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-01-17-convt-perf/) goes into details and is easily applied to your own Golang code. 

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
