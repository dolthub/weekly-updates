This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 



### We Need Your `pgdump`s

We're getting really close to launching [Doltgres in Beta](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-08-06-doltgres-beta/). We've crossed a number of our targeted milestones already including [Hosted Doltgres](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-07-hosted-doltgres/) and [Doltgres Workbench Support](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-10-17-dolt-workbench-supports-doltgres/). 

But now, we need your help. [We need a collection of `pgdumps`](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-19-we-need-your-pgdumps/) so we can test Doltgres DDL compatibility with Postgres. We know most potential Doltgres users are going to try and import their existing database as a first step. If it doesn't work, they are likely to stop using Doltgres. So, we'll take your `pgdump`s if you're willing to share. Schema only is fine. Obfuscated column names is also fine. Reply to this email if you want to help us out.

### Robot Blogger

As some of you know, we recently [launched Vector Support in Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-06-getting-started-dolt-vectors/). To showcase Dolt's vector capabilities and explore the generative AI space more broadly, we're working on a robot blogger project which we will eventually open source. In service of that project, [Dustin](https://www.dolthub.com/team#dustin) wrote a blog about his journey learning about [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-18-learning-about-rag/), RAG for short. If you're curious to learn more about this new space, definitely give [his article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-18-learning-about-rag/) a read. Expect more articles on this from him but also from our new robot friend.

### Go Tests in GitHub Actions

The latest in [our Golang Blog series](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/?q=golang) is about [running Go tests using GitHub actions](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-02-14-simple-github-test-ci-with-go/). One of the reasons we can [fix Dolt bugs in 24 hours](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-15-24-hour-bug-fixes/) is because of our robust testing infrastructure, facilitated by GitHub actions. Check out [the article](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-15-24-hour-bug-fixes/) to learn more.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
