This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Happy new year! Thanks for reading my stupid jokes in 2023. In 2024, expect more of the same lame content to kick off this email. If you want funny, watch [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb2AvF8XzII&t=128s).

### Rebase is here



### Push to a Running Dolt Server



### Dolt Workbench Supports Postgres



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
