This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

Next week is Thanksgiving week in the USA so you will be getting no Friday email. Your obliques will be giving thanks for not having to read any of my side-splitting humor.

### JSON Showdown: Dolt vs SQLite

We're starting to think that [Prolly Trees are the best way to store JSON in a database](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-07-15-json-prolly-trees/). Dolt has taken the Pepsi challenge against [MySQL](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-09-json-mysql-vs-dolt/) and [Postgres](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-09-22-json-postgres-vs-dolt/) on our JSON benchmarks and come out on top. This week [Nick](https://www.dolthub.com/team#nick) has [Dolt take on SQLite](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-18-json-sqlite-vs-dolt/). Dolt is faster than SQLite for JSON for most operations.

If you have a heavy JSON use case, let's see if we can get you on Dolt so you can enjoy all these performance wins and get the benefits of version control. 

### Postgres' Missing Features

As many of you know we're hard at work on [Doltgres](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql), our Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. Throw is a [star on GitHub](https://github.com/dolthub/doltgresql) if you haven't already. This week, [Zach](https://www.dolthub.com/team#zach) wrote about all the [quality of life features MySQL has but Postgres doesn't](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-19-postgres-missing-quality-of-life-features/). We're going to keep some of them in Doltgres. We really like things like `show create table`.

### HIPAA Compliance

DoltHub is now [HIPAA compliant](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-11-15-hipaa/). It was pretty easy to get because there is a lot of overlap with [SOC2](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-22-soc2/), which we achieved in May. If you have a healthcare data use case and you've been waiting for HIPAA compliance, now is the time to get moving on your Dolt project.

Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
