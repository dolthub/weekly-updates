This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

We made a mascot/logo for [`go-mysql-server`](https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server) this week.

We hope you like it. We had some debate about bowtie on or off. I made the case that it makes him look like he's leading a double life as [Magic `go-mysql-server`](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1915581/). Reply to this email for more details.

### Clone a Hosted Dolt



### Dolt Architecture Primer



### Panic! 



Until next week. As always, just reply to this email if you want to chat.
