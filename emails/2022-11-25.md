This is the weekly CEO update from [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/). I'm Tim, the CEO of DoltHub. 

I'm going to be thankful instead because 'tis the season. I quit Snapchat on Dec. 1, 2017, almost 5 years ago. I left Snapchat on Friday and started this company on Monday. By Thursday, I was like "I'm not sure I want to do this right now" and quit my own start up 4 days in. About 6 months later [Aaron](https://www.dolthub.com/team/aaron) and [Brian](https://www.dolthub.com/team/brian) said "Hey Tim, if you're going to do this , we'll do this with you." Now, we built something cool and useful and I'm having a great time doing it. I'm thankful for Aaron and Brian and all the cofounders out there. They don't even read these so I don't need to be bashful here.
